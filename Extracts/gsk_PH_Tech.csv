Welcome to the new year!
Hope all of you had a restful time with your family and friends and a #emailfree holiday season. If any of you had to work during the holidays to support our business, regardless of which function you work for, please accept my sincere thank you!
I am excited about 2019 as it is going to be a big year for Pharma. We evidenced a flow of business news in Q4 - the Tesaro acquisition to support our Oncology pipeline, followed by the Consumer Health JV + separation plans that serves the dual purpose of making our CH business the best in it‚Äôs class while also setting us up to invest strategically and make the right bets for the Pharmaceutical pipeline. I truly believe we are taking our best shots on goal with these moves. While our business continues to execute the strategy laid out by Emma and the CET meticulously, it is CRITICAL that we in Tech keep a relentless focus on our IPT agenda and execute our commitments in support of these outcomes.
In my first 90 days on the job, I have observed two key strengths in our PharmaTech team. First is that we have a phenomenal capability to execute and deliver on our commitments, once clear goals are set and the path is cleared for execution. Second, is that we collaborate well as a team when we have mutual purpose.
So, I ask each of you to do two things within the first two weeks of 2019.
1) Please take the time to clarify for yourself, with your business partners and your Pharma Tech LT member, what your objectives are and set your compass for success.
2) Set a ‚ÄúLearn and Grow‚Äù goal for yourself and make it visible to your manager and your team (and me if you‚Äôd like), so they can support you in the journey.
My focus for 2019 is to #KeepitREAL for Pharma Tech.
R - Relentless focus on our IPT objectives
E - Enable our digital future
A - Always Win Together &
L - Learn and grow as a team
We will have a town-hall in early Q1 to discuss our 2019 IPT Objectives. I will follow up with quarterly Let‚Äôs Talk sessions at various sites with my LT members to have smaller group discussions on how we to shape 2019 to be the best year yet for PharmaTech.
Meanwhile, I want to welcome the new year with a new initiative that I am co-opting from Amy Landucci‚Äôs inspiring challenge about #meetingfreefridays and #timetothink. Check out Amy‚Äôs post below and let‚Äôs try to positively change the way we manage our time so we can bring our best selves to work at GSK.

As we make a shift to agile, please read an expert practitioners view of what to keep in mind as we progress our journey in 2019.
I have seen modern technology organizations presumably running agile methodologies to deliver value at pace for their customers, get so obsessed with the ‚Äòprocess‚Äô rather than the flow and outcome, that they ironically became brittle and rigid defeating the very purpose of adopting agile.

Please take a minute to say a warm PharmaTech thanks (actually say it, don‚Äôt just like the post:) to 3 relatively quiet but very important contributors to our success in 2018.
Chirag Patel runs our Pharma Tech Finance and has magician like capabilities to make it all seem too easy to run a financial portfolio as complex as ours. I admire his customer focus and orientation and he has mastered that very clever balance of governance and enablement. There is not a day that goes by when, I have not thanked Chirag mentally.
Ying Liang Chai runs our risk management team and she and her team partner with our regions and the core to ensure we are on top of our Trust agenda.
Agnieszka Surowicz and her team have supported and enabled us throughout the year and are an integral part of our talent story. She has helped me onboard rapidly and helped me make sense of the organization and culture so I can merge into the fast lane.

Last Monday the Australian LOC transitioned from Zinc to Content Lab and have already approved their first document inside the new platform.
Today, our Japanese colleagues are cutting over to Content Lab from their Vault platform, joining the global community as we launch a single source of content for GSK.
2018 Milestones
With the addition of these 2 LOCs, our 2018 plan for deployment has been completed, on-time and at pace, having adjusted some launch dates forward to meet the business need.
Over the past 3 months, Content Lab has been deployed to all of our Service Agencies (MOC, DC, KC), all* Franchise teams, the US LOC, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. At this time, we now have:
Over 1,300 GSK Users Live
More than 300 Agency Users Live
More than 4,000 pieces of content
*the Oncology Franchise will transition in March 2019
2019 Preparation
During this same window, the Content Lab team has also prepared for 2019 deployments across our EU and remaining Intercontinental LOCs by holding requirements gathering workshops with the EU5 markets, all EMC markets, plus Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The high-level deployment schedule is as follows:
Content Hub go live February 1
EU & Intercontinental spread across February & March
China, India, and the remaining Emerging Markets throughout late April and May
About Content Lab
Content Lab is a new marketing technology platform that replaces all of our copy approval platforms and content repositories. It is a Digital Asset Management (DAM) system that includes copy approval. The Content Lab program is an enterprise-wide program operating on VFQ principles (Value, Flow, Quality) with the overall ambition and objective to Make It Easier for our teams to get great content to market by putting global materials at their fingertips for content reuse and streamlining the localization process. Content Lab will be the single source of content at GSK, and by doing so, will also help enable a more robust content analytics environment for GSK.
Delivering the Content Lab program at pace in 2018 has been incredibly exciting. It‚Äôs also been demanding at times and has asked a lot of the people behind the scenes driving and implementing this change. We want to thank you for your leadership and support and we look forward to 2019 and the successful completion of deployment of Content Lab. Your teams and the people across the geographies at GSK have been great partners.
We wish you a restful year-end break, and look forward to a fantastic 2019 together!

Obviously, Agile Transformation has been a high priority for us all and we continue to look at how we move to a product oriented organisation and transform our processes and controls. Cindy Bennett is experimenting with Intercontinental on governance, Marcia Pinho is experimenting in Emerging Markets with strategic planning and BRP. Fabrice D'Alberto and Dany Bogemans have been busy defining our Product Landscape and are experimenting with Power BI to provide us with a tool to model this.

He is now experimenting with a streamlined process that we aim to introduce in early 2019 and is using Power BI as a tool to visualise our technical landscape.

Just a reminder for you to complete your year end Workday activities by 31 December please.  

This includes employee comments as well as manager comments as well as uploading your My Plan document (or adding objectives manually to Workday).

To clarify, a manager may 'save for later' or 'submit' his/her comments. 'Save for Later' comments will auto submit on 31 December. 

The recommendation is to 'save for later' as this makes it easier to edit comments should the need arise.

The session enhanced my knowledge of the Specialty space within the Pharmaceutical industry and the role accurate data analysis plays in the success of a specialty product.  Please see below for my key takeaways and notes attached to learn more about what my day consisted of!
please note, the attached document is for Internal Use only and should not be shared with customers
Key Learnings:
Fill rate is an important metric to measure the success of your specialty product and aggregator relationship/contract. However, it does not tell the whole story. A deep dive into the sub-status data will reveal barriers to success.
Integration with Health System Specialty Pharmacies (SPs) is impactful as patients within these systems will more likely than not utilize the SP already in this system. Also, these Health Systems already have EHR for all of their patients ‚Äì aligning to a more wholistic view of the patient and treatment information.
NCPDP: their mission is to create and promote standards for electronic exchange of healthcare information related to pharmacy services
Responsible for identifying pain points within specialty pharmacy and determines if an electronic solution is available.
Highlights what data elements are to be included in eScripts.
They are in the process of creating standard for real time co-pay information known as Real Time Prescription Benefit Check.
The Triple Aim Value model will enhance the effectiveness of specialty products for patients by:
Improving Health through clinical support
Lowering Costs through increased formulary coverage and negotiations.
Better Patient Care through more accurate drug selection.
There are many opportunities to enhance specialty data, but this will only happen through strategic account management with data aggregators. This is vital to patient access and adherence to specialty medicines.
Early engagement with data aggregators and clearly defined contract conditions including, but not limited to clearly defined sub-status codes will lead to a successful launch and growth of specialty products.",Paul Karoly uploaded a file.,647,0,23:21,0

There are too many successes to pick out individual high points, as all of these deliveries have had challenges but as a collective the team have met and overcome them.
I also reflect on the One Device project which closed out in 2018. Again this was a challenge to all involved and it was only delivered with great partnership with the Tech Ops team, and I thank Lee Maw and his team for his work with us on this.
Obviously there have been some bigger challenges in 2018, and I think the T360 performance issue is a great example of where the Pharma Tech team all pulled together. We were also supported by the Tech Ops team and in particular Steve Miller and Eric Andrews.

Successful deployment of W5+/ 4.1. Thank you GCS for making the pull-through so smooth, special thanks to Sule Pasin Hogburn for being with us every step of the way
Achieving GDPR compliance for our systems as week early - thank you Rodolfo Isotta and Gianfranco Pugno for your tireless persistence
Smashing our 8% decommissioning target and delivering 17% reduction in the number of EU Tech local systems - encourage/ assisted/ measured by Fabrice D'Alberto
One Device - they said it couldn't be done but they hadn't met Carole Carriere & Adam Wilson. And let's not forget that Natalia Sakellariou was the first to withdraw the PCs in any EU market
Project Goddard - the UK Pharma Tech team worked tirelessly with GA&D to deliver a benefit case that eclipsed by 60% the biggest one that I ever delievred when I was in UK Tech
eCommerce in Poland - we are taking and dispatching orders and the customers LOVE it! Well done to Poland Tech, Alvin Coleman's team in USA Pharma Tech, and GA&D for the first Hybris delivery outside of the USA!
T360 is now deployed to most markets allowing reps to better territory plan - thank you to Charles Chen and Max Salvadori for leading this charge
I have also recruited some great new Tech Directors, I won't embarrass them here by naming them but I will thank Amaury Lorthiois, Andrea Zenari, and Imran Bhat for stepping up and leading the teams whilst I recruited

There are SO MANY people and teams that I should thank and haven't put in the list - for example I have just remembered that I haven't mentioned the work that Kerry Ives did on MindTickle to make the tool faster to deploy across other markets. THANK YOU to all of you.

103,17,08/12/2018,98,"My reflections on the December Global Tech Town-hall
I attended the Global Tech Town Hall from our Navy Yard office this week. On my flight back home, I reflected on the conversation at the Town Hall and some of our site level Let‚Äôs Talk sessions. Even as we celebrated some extraordinary success stories from 2018 and I got to know so many employees and their perspectives, I was also saddened to hear that some of our colleagues are feeling under valued and unsettled about the changes in flight.
Personally, I have encountered nothing but grace, openness, resilience, passion and knowledge about our business and patients in my first two months here. I have respect and gratitude for each and every Pharma Tech colleague and their contributions to our company and its mission. The language around the old and the new, was particularly sad to hear, because, from my vantage point I can see some amazing opportunities to bring together our collective knowledge and talent in service of our company‚Äôs transformation. It‚Äôs why I came to GSK. There is so much to do and our patients are counting on us to be a team.
I wish I could just say that no one on our Pharma Tech team feels this way, but I am certain that‚Äôs not true. So, I simply want to say ‚ÄòI hear you‚Äô and I will do everything I can to help you ‚Äòbe you, feel good and learn and grow‚Äô.
My commitment is that my LT and I will work to strengthen the cross PharmaTech communities in each site that we operate in and create opportunities for two way dialog with us, to hear your concerns and also to give you the information you need to make sense of and navigate the Tech Transformation.
I also know and assure you that the Tech LT stands shoulder to shoulder on this transformation and we respect each other‚Äôs experience and unconditionally support each other‚Äôs success.
I ask 3 things of you:
1. Continue to be open and honest with us
2. Let‚Äôs remember our core values and expectations when expressing our opinions and concerns
3. Don‚Äôt give away the power you have to shape your own destiny, career and experience at GSK
I look forward to talking to all of you at one of the two Global Pharma Tech Town Halls on Dec 11th. Let‚Äôs win together. If you have other ideas on what we can do post them here.

120,7,07/12/2018,37,"Currently in GSK we have a single global  Incident Management tool - Remedy.
One of the growing pains of IT organizations moving from Service based teams into more Product based and Devops driven groups is effective management of both - Dev and Ops and having a separate tool and processes for each.
Right now many teams are using Remedy for IM and JIRA for anything else in their daily work. This creates an overhead and unabillity for everyone to fully see a true E2E and drives segmentation on many levels.
We believe that if there is a delivery group focused around single goal, they should have a single tool to support all their key tasks, no matter if it`s dev or ops.
That`s why we will be running a small scale pilot for JIRA Ops and OpsGenie to see and learn on how modern IM approach can seamlessly integrate and drive our release roadmap and product backlogs - all within single tool.

- Automatically publish approved content and attached renditions through a URL
- Published URLs automatically direct to the latest approved content
- Content automatically pulled upon withdrawal or expiration. Job operations can be created that send notification of expiration to roles on related documents that are associated to the expired asset.
- High level usage tracking can be ingested back into Vault, giving the ability to build reports and dashboards on content that is published through Vault Digital Publishing.

Just attended an executive roundtable with Andy Williams (Head of Medical Operations) and peer Pharma companies. It was interesting to hear how other companies had tackled similar challenges for content (promotional and non-promotional including medical). Key take-aways:
- Content is being considered in its broadest context i.e. promotional and non-promotional including medical. Historically, the emphasis has been on commercial content with Medical somewhat under-invested . There is now a ground-swell of recognition that medical is key to shaping the market and responds to HCP preference to focus more on the science and outcomes hence attracting greater attention and investment.
- In many cases GSK is ahead of the pack especially when it comes to driving content reuse which can be attributed to the top-down approach we‚Äôve taken and the strong business sponsorship
- Digital has definitely disrupted and challenges thinking on how content is created, curated and retired. Fragment based content is becoming a pre-requisite and the ‚Äúdigital-halo‚Äù that accompanies a subscriber allows for personalisation at point of need. This is prompting a review of the whole content process i.e. creation, review & approval and distribution.
- Real excitement around looking at automated content distribution and AI to improve efficiency in an on-demand digital world.",Balvinder Dhillon,799,0,16:02,0

Second outcome from our GCS Hackathon that we want to transform into recurring activity between different groups. 

Together with Jakub Gorgolewski and Witold Rudnicki we have built E2E solution for Google Search Console automation. This process is extremely time-consuming for services I'm managing on the daily basis. 
Automation is delivered in Selenium and we have used Python as our scripting language.
In a result, we have achieved:
CLI - with error handlers and base of hints for all defined methods
Possibility of adding and removing users for each functional account (which is associated with the domain, e.g. sensodyne.co.uk or gskpro.com/de-de) into Google Search Console.
3)  Enhancement to adding and removing users based on BU (like ViiV, CH, Pharma, Vx)

This solution is an amazing example how to speed up process of granting necessary accesses to our Requesters. Everything that we have achieved, is built based on Google Cloud Identity and Access Management policy we are following. It's a milestone for Digital Media and Search Service team.

I've already shared my thoughts on the first half of the visit in the previous post, and now I wanted to share remaining observations and key learnings.
First of all, I was invited by Matthew to participate in the US PT LT and had the opportunity to join the Charelle Lewis session on ""Core Platforms"" and also to share EM Tech agenda and portfolio of projects/products on behalf of Kevin Li and EM team. We had an excellent overview and agreed with Chuck Kita and Sandra McKeown on several points of potential collaboration between US/EM teams.
Later on, we had deep-dive and demo sessions to review the latest products developments supported by Pharma Tech US such as Contact Centre presented by Kevin Harvey and Hybris presented by eCommerce team. There is a significant progress, and I'm looking forward to our future collaboration to have all these technologies in our markets.
We also had a separate session dedicated to Customer Engagement initiatives where Sandra McKeown shared an interesting and insightful story behind the current DDA structure and ways of working in US Pharma, reinforcing the importance of appropriate sponsorship and endorsement from key stakeholders.
Next, I can't underestimate the value of our discussions about VFQ journey with Brian Sondeen, Rich Brents, Rose Furmanski, Chuck Kita and Jeremy Pincus. Few key insights to share (#agilepharma #vfq #productmanagement):
We should define our core PRODUCTS in local markets and region to start truly practising VFQ, instead of selecting 30% of projects as we planned in the beginning.
It's not possible to have full benefits of VFQ and Product Management without appropriate rebalance in the teams. We can't change only mindset without making necessary adjustments in all other parts of the puzzle.
It is quite challenging to engage commercial colleagues into VFQ journey and training without strong support from Senior Pharma Commercial Leaders, but it is still possible, and we have discussed some best practices with Chuck from his recent interactions with several products teams.
Finally, Jeremy presented the real-life example of VFQ and Agile practice with stand-up meeting posters, Kanban boards and other tools used for Shingrix Digital transformation initiative in the US market. We already use many similar tools online in EM, but we haven‚Äôt had a real physical board yet due to the remote nature of collaboration and geographical spread in EM region. So it was good to see this example, and it reminded me of ADP walls and boards which we used during the MCM transformation with Russian marketing, medical and sales teams back in the days.
Thanks once again, to Matthew Lasmanis, Brian Sondeen, Julia Alden and everyone, it was great to see the excellent partnership with commercial and meet the strong, dedicated team! The US market is unique, but there is still a lot of common challenges and opportunities.",Almas Dautbay is feeling inspired with Sandra McKeown and 6 others.,995,0,00:58,0

The team led by Rajender Jawalker and Eric Moe has successfully established the first data source - Veeva Promo-mat (Content Lab) in the Azure Production environment after it was received on Oct 8th.  This deliverable was part of the MOC Analytic sprint, and the team has adopted API based integration for data ingestion to establish the required data foundation.
This very first step marks the critical milestone where the MOC Analytic Power BI report (Content Re-use) is built by our strategic partner, Accentrue. The data is rendered from Azure production environment and the project stays on the right track to go live targeted on Dec 7th, 2018.
Kyle Donalddon - our product owner for MOC analytic has provided a strong leadership to help the team focused on the prioritization of the product back log to ensure we can deliver the value early.
I like to take this opportunity to share our sincere appreciate to the Global Platform Team, Dean Shannon and Shalin Simmons who have provided the guidance and consultation along the way to make this possible.  We look forward to the continual strong partnership with them.

Effective 1st December 2018, Nigeria and Kenya Pharma LOCs will become part of the Export Markets unit of Emerging Markets. This change will provide dedicated support and focus for these two key Performance markets as they pursue their growth agendas into 2019. Nigeria and Kenya will be two of the largest businesses by sales in Export Markets.    

This administrative change does not have any impact on roles except for the consequent commercial and functional reporting line changes. Investment in these businesses and their ongoing business plans are not affected.   

David Pritchard, VP Africa & Developing Countries Asia, said:  ‚ÄúI want to thank all of the teams in Nigeria and Kenya for their tremendous contribution to the Africa DC business. Over the last couple of years they have continued to deliver market beating sales growth and improved profitability, despite a challenging external environment and a significant degree of change internally. I am proud of the progress that we have made together and it has been a pleasure to work with Bhushan Akshikar, Bridget Wachira and this year with Alexandra Spang directly to accelerate our competitiveness. I am sure both countries will go from strength from strength with the new Export Organisation under Bridget‚Äôs leadership.‚Äù  

Dylan Jackson, VP Export Markets, said:  ‚ÄúNigeria and Kenya LOCs are on significant transformation journeys, a lot has been achieved already in 2018 to increase focus, pace and accountability and the Export Markets team is ready to support them as they move forward to the next phase. We are fortunate to be welcoming many colleagues with talent and experience into the Export Markets unit through this change. They will be strong partners for our existing eight promotion markets, especially the LOCs in South Africa, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and I hope to see them making an impact in Emerging Markets more widely.‚Äù",Cigdem Cirik shared a post.,906,0,10:17,0

Some key requests for help that I got was to simplify 1) the amount of paperwork that people need to fill out for even simple projects - Elin Green would like to get your help to understand this and help solve the team challenges 2) laying out a crisp Data and BI tech stack strategy so people can move towards the right reference architecture over time.

In the context of the Survey - Q24 and the overall ‚ÄúMake it easier‚Äù initiative, I am becoming more and more concerned about users‚Äô impact of the CRUIZ project.
Key concerns can be summarized as follows:
‚Ä¢ Janitor functionality is not user-friendly (e.g. no warnings on what deleted, no option to archive content offline instead of deleting)
‚Ä¢ Risk of deleting business critical documents with retention date > 3 years
‚Ä¢ Risk of not being able to fulfill local authorities requests
‚Ä¢ Guidelines and instructions are either not practical or not clear for the end users (e.g. many employees don‚Äôt even know what GCMS is)
‚Ä¢ Very little time for change management and training activities from the moment that Janitor functionality was finalized
‚Ä¢ Risk of deleting personal data (storage of personal data in GSK system is allowed)
‚Ä¢ Poor user experience of proposed solutions for longer retention (e.g. GCMS) and limited access to such resources (e.g. OneDevice users can access neither U: drive nor GCMS)

  Title : GSK Internet Services EOY Freeze
Contents :
Service Name ‚Äì GSK Internet Services. 
Situation: 
As part of the GSK End of Year (EOY) Shutdown, GSK Internet Services‚Äô Maintenances/Changes will be frozen to ensure all services remain as stable as possible and service issues are minimized. This standard EOY GSK Internet Service change freeze is to ensure there are no system or environment wide changes or maintenances that occur, which could impact multiple GSK Internet Websites during the GSK EOY shutdown. This is similar to the Red Alert change freeze followed the week of GSK quarterly earnings releases.
Start Time: 
15-Dec-2018 @ 12:00 AM GMT
End Time: 
06-Jan-2019 @ 11:59 PM GMT
Business Impact: 
This freeze is only for GSK Internet service maintenances/changes. This freeze is for the underlying Infrastructure systems, servers, and services that impact GSK public facing Internet Websites hosted on GSK Internet Services.
This GSK Internet Service Systems/Environment Change Freeze does not impact individual Internet Websites content changes or updates. Websites may be updated as normal and regular GSK Internet Services support will be available over the GSK EOY shutdown from the GSK Internet Service Support teams, however, users are requested to read the important note provided below.
Important Notes: 
‚Ä¢           No go-live on Fridays/Weekends is applicable during this period.
‚Ä¢           It is important to make sure any planned individual Website activities (like Go-Live or bulk site setup) during the EOY period requiring support, are planned and communicated to the support team 3 weeks in advance. This will help the Hosting Support team ensure everything is planned and outlined and project don‚Äôt overlap with other planned releases/activities.
‚Ä¢           If there are any go-lives required, teams need to make sure that go-live testing is lined up. I.e. Site Owner/Dev/QA resource as well as brand resource are online and available to verify the update and resolve any issues. Hosting will not launch a site without these testing and approval resources being online and available. 
‚Ä¢           The hosting and infrastructure support will be providing 24x7 emergency support throughout the EOY shutdown, for any business critical/emergency production issues. 
Audience:
You are receiving this communication because you have been identified as a Stakeholder for a Website or service hosted on the GSK Internet Services .

A number of teams across Tech, and the wider GSK organisation, have been using a public cloud based ‚Äòsticky note‚Äô tool called Trello, which is hosted in the US.    
Because name and email address (basic Personal Information) are required to register and use the site, this poses a Privacy risk.  
We have also found that some teams have set up Trello accounts which were left fully open - the content was freely available to anyone that cared to view it on the internet.  
In GSK for us to store PI and any confidential GSK information, a Privacy Impact Assessment and a Data Security Assessment must be completed and an enterprise contract in place with Trello. It is possible to do this, but has not been done in the case of Trello. 
This means that Trello is not currently approved for use for GSK business activities and any teams in Pharma Tech using it must stop immediately. 
The enterprise version of Jira is in the process of being implemented and this provides Kanban board functionality, and GSK already has the Brown Paper tool which is available for use.

I just wanted to take a few minutes to share some of the stories I heard here in Denver, CO at the ViiV US National Sales Meeting.
Story 1 - This afternoon we had the pleasure of meeting Wendell. When Wendell was diagnosed with AIDs, he was told he only had 8 days to live. Miraculously, a month later Wendell was discharged from the hospital. It took Wendell a while to find a treatment regimen that was sustainable long-term with his allergies and other health issues, but ultimately he and his HCP found a regimen that allowed Wendell to achieve an ‚Äúundetectable‚Äù state (Undetectable means keeping the amount of HIV-1 in the blood at very low levels - less than 50 copies per mL). Now that Wendell‚Äôs long term outlook has improved drastically, he and his HCP are doing everything in their power to reduce the long term effects of his medicines and interactions with his allergies. He started taking Juluca in Feb 2018 and he continues to thrive on this amazing new 2DR treatment today!
Story 2 ‚Äì We also had the pleasure of talking to an HCP this afternoon. This HCP told the story of a patient who was experiencing severe side effects from HIV. When tested, the patient‚Äôs viral load exceeded 10,000,000 copies (this is extremely high). The HCP prescribed a regime that included Tivicay. Within 3 days the patient felt back to normal and within 4 weeks the patient was able to achieve ‚Äúundetectable‚Äù state.
The work we do is important! The projects we support (the websites we enable, the eDetails we produce, the systems we support for Customers, HCPs, Field Employees and Home Office Employees) help inform the HCPs ultimately enabling Patients to access our medications. Our contributions are making a difference in the daily lives of the patients. I love attending events like this because it reminds me of how my work is making a difference.

During the ViiV US National Sales meeting last week, I specifically sought out the perspective of Account Managers new to ViiV/GSK to understand how our IT systems compared to their previous Company's and I collected these two gems in particular:

One of our competitors seems to have a tighter integration between Veeva and Concur. This Account Manager said at their previous company, they were able to record a group call in Veeva (specifying all the attendees who participated and the amount they spent on the call) and the call entry in Veeva would automatically create a new expense report in Concur with all of the attendees already attached and the total amount equally distributed...
One of our Account Manager's indicated at their previous Company, they used ME ID number to search for customers in Veeva. Since they were using a universal external ID, they didn't have the same issue we experience with duplicate CIDs and the CID Merge Process...

328,2,17/10/2018,16,"A year and a half ago, we began a journey to decrease Page Load Time on Consumer Healthcare websites. We began this journey because of our Active Monitoring MVP done with SOASTA mPulse on Flonase. With our MVP, we found that ‚Äì if we reduced the Page Load Time to < 3 seconds, the Completed Sessions for the webpage increased by 20% (bounce rate reduced by 20%). We knew that to reduce Page Speed to this for a majority of people, we needed to meet this equation: (.003 GB √ó 9000 / 14 Mb/s = 2.5714285714 s ‚âà 3 s) where .003 = 3MB Page Weight, 14 Mb/s = ~ average Internet Speed of Priority Markets according to Akamai‚Äôs State of the Internet Report, and 9000 as the simplified modifier for TCP octet calculation taking into account lack in efficiency of VLAN and PPPoE encapsulated connections. In order to do this, our Next Best Action to bulk-increase Page Speed was to compress all images to the appropriate device viewport with an allowable ~20% pinch to zoom before pixilation for resistive and capacitive displays. This means - no matter who our customer is or what device they come to GSK‚Äôs CHC brands on ‚Äì we give our customer the best sized image for their device and the best possible ‚Äúdigital‚Äù experience for images. While Completed Sessions and impact are hard to measure based on the approach we took to implement the solution ‚Äì we do know this: Images accounted for ~70% of total current Page Weight at the beginning of 2018 for the top 25 CHC websites. We also know that ‚Äì as of last month ‚Äì we have successfully served 2Bn optimized images to end users with a 99.999571% success rate and 8 ms response time. This significantly improves Page Speed on the CHC portfolio using Imgix and the Fastly CDN scattered points of presence network. We look forward to implementing this same technology on GSKpro and the Rx/Vx/ViiV portfolio very soon. Thanks to the Imgix project team for helping make this happen.

Approach to developing digital assets will change drastically in order to keep up with the demand on speed of software delivery and incredible demand in job marketplace. 
CI/CD is a step in a right direction but input into this change delivery method ( e.g. code ) is currently still using the hands-on approach even with simple POC`s at testing stage. 
This requires people, time and money everytime we do a round of iterations for each project even in early stages. 
We need at least one developer to do anything.
The way we transform idea/mock-ups  into code will change. And this change will transform the industry once enterprise jumps on board and will be fully automated and technology agnostic.
This will then redefine the role of developer so he can focus on complex problem solving and deep integrations development instead of working on 9999th iteration of a wireframe for a single project.
Yes, AI and Machine Learning is overhyped massively but video below shows a symptom of a things to come and there is already more people working on it worldwide. 
https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/10/25/airbnb-ai-sketches-design-code/
https://github.com/ashnkumar/sketch-code
We will be looking at at least dozen of different approaches to solve this particullar problem ( AI or not AI driven) and the leading solution will appear in not so distant future and once enterprise jumps on it - then it will become an industry standard.

First, please join me in thanking Manjeet Aujla for his contributions to Pharma Tech over the past several years. Manjeet has built a great team and has been laser focused on building a strong execution and delivery engine for the Pharma business. Both,he and his team have built some great partnerships with our business. Manjeet‚Äòs commitment to GSK‚Äòs success and its people was palpable in our interactions, and he has been most generous with his time, advice and ideas as I have come onboard. Please join me in thanking Manjeet for his contributions to the Pharma business and wish him the best as he heads over to the Vaccines Tech team. I am glad that I can continue to partner with him on the Tech LT.
I have had a chance to meet most of the Pharma Tech LT by now and I have been impressed with the caliber and capability of the leaders I have encountered. Manjeet and I have had a few on-boarding sessions going over the Pharma business, our key priorities and all your incredible achievements and our team. I was also in the UK with the Tech LT at our offsite last week, where we discussed our 2019 IPT Objectives and how we can come together as a high performing team. I am excited to build on our strengths and our success, to be the best Pharma Tech team in the industry.
I will be in listening/learning mode for the next several weeks. I will be visiting key sites/markets and meeting our business partners. I want to meet each and every one of you and hear your thoughts.
Meanwhile, reach out to me via Workplace or email, and let me know:
What is working well? What can we do better?
What is exciting? What is challenging?
What is one thing you would like me to know as I come onboard? What would you like to know about me?
We have a ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs Talk‚Äô session scheduled on October 4th and I hope to see you all there and answer some of your questions and share my thoughts!

But he‚Äôs still experimenting with the best format: a convenience store that sells fresh prepared foods as well as a limited grocery selection similar to 7-Eleven franchises, or a place to simply pick up a quick bite to eat for people in a rush, similar to the U.K.-based chain Pret a Manger, one of the people said.    https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-19/amazon-is-said-to-plan-up-to-3-000-cashierless-stores-by-2021

450,0,20/09/2018,2,"API's vs Webhook! 
 WHAT IS AN API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface, but what does that really mean? Rather than what it is, I find it easier to talk about what APIs enable. APIs can share data or functionality. For example, you might use a places API to look up restaurants by location or name, pulling out a lot of data about each place. Then you might combine that with a mapping API, using it as an interface for displaying your data.
Programmers who make a request to an API will then receive a response. For example, using our Web API to send an email, you‚Äôd pass the email contents with the request. If all goes well, you will receive a response declaring success.
WHAT IS A WEBHOOK?
Sometimes people call webhooks reverse APIs, but perhaps more accurately a webhook lets you skip a step. With most APIs there‚Äôs a request followed by a response. No request is required for a webhook, it just sends the data when it‚Äôs available.
To use a webhook, you register a URL with the company providing the service. That URL is a place within your application that will accept the data and do something with it. In some cases, you can tell the provider the situations when you‚Äôd like to receive data. Whenever there‚Äôs something new, the webhook will send it to your URL.",Vivek Sivakumar shared a post.,1247,0,18:24,0

People asked him how he managed to survive. ""I accommodated myself to the water, not the water to me. Without thinking, I allowed myself to be shaped by it. Plunging into the swirl, I came out with the swirl. This is how I survived.""
We live in a world of uncertainty but plan and act as though we are certain of the future. By embracing uncertainty like the river rapids, rather than ignoring or working against it, we can improve our ability to adapt to changes, incorporate new information, improve our process, and optimize our outcomes.

I have a friend who is a Philospsohy Professor who specialises in the Philosopy of Science (https://tinyurl.com/ych4nwg3.)
He is looking to try and understand the root of as many different languages words for ""Science"" as possible to include in an upcoming paper.
I would be very grateful if you could spend 2 minutes to share your language's word for ""science"" and its etymology (i.e. where the word comes from).

Original post from Alexander below:
Linguistic assistance, please!  In some languages (English and Romance languages) the word meaning 'science' is etymologically related to a word meaning 'know' (scire in Latin).  In some other languages (Germanic languages other than English) the word for 'science' is related to the word for 'know' in that language (eg. Wissenschaft/wissen).  In the Slavic languages, I am told, there is no such relation (the word for 'science' is related to words meaning 'learn' or 'teach').  I think Finnish and Hungarian are like the Germanic languages in this respect.  But I'm not sure (can anyone confirm or deny this?)   So two questions:       (1) Can you give me examples of languages from other language families where science/know are linguistically related, or where they are not?       (2) Are there any languages where the connection is between the word for 'science' and the word for 'true'? Thank you!",Kieron Scrutton is with Iwo Mikolajczak and 5 others.,2097,0,09:05,0

All those who have already been scheduled to migrate to Windows 10, including early adopters, will migrate as planned.   The objective is to:  
1. Complete the Windows 10 migration as quickly as possible, prioritising the top 50 GSK sites which account for 60% of our colleagues  
2. Move to an Evergreen environment based on Microsoft Office 365 with the Windows 10 operating system. This will help to provide the latest technology to colleagues, faster.

After the initial tests, it seems that the tool allows all service managers to save some time and fully automate the process of preparing statistics for the Service Review meetings. You can use almost as easy as the pivot table in Excel. The tool allows you to publish the website with metrics and refresh data from the Remedy database on a daily or even hourly basis. After you will publish your metrics you can easily share the website with other colleagues who will be able to use dynamic filters and charts to check what is interesting for them. If you are interested of what you can do in this tool, please check the attached screenshots. Want to know more, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Now it's time for a question. The only one thing which you require to publish your stats and make them available is the Power BI Pro licence. I would like to ask you if the process for requesting the professional licence for Pharma Tech users exist? I know that the Consumer Tech has the process in place which allows users raising a request to get the professional licence of Power BI.
Thank you in advance for your help.

During the three day packed event, the whole team had ample opportunity to connect and focus together on strategic priorities as a team in a fast flowing pace.   

EMC Head of Commercial Operation, Juan David Quinones Amezquita opened the first day with his presentation highlighting the efficiencies of digital touchpoints and where we need to focus our efforts on. His key message was focused on increasing field force effectiveness including increased utilization of Veeva system and other available digital platforms. 

Next on the agenda, EMC Head of Tech, Almas Dautbay updated the whole team on 2018 tech objectives and strategy. VFQ principles were shared among the group was met with excitement from all participants and the real life experience of using these in a project such as Compass was shared with the whole group. #agilepharma

EMC BI Manager, Sinan Calik updated the Tech Heads about current BI landscape and the expected business effect of the upcoming tools such as T360, Compass and Single Customer View on our ways of working. First day was wrapped up with Digital Program Updates from GCS Client Engagement Manager, Sule Pasin Hogburn who informed the group on HCP Platforms and Wave 5 deployments updates that were all concluded successfully. Finally, EM Content Hub Director Khawar Khan, talked about the newly created EM Content Hub and the upcoming Content Lab solution deployment. At the conclusion of this session, everybody had a clear feeling of the flow of content from generation, all the way to consumption by HCP‚Äôs and how to make it all in a smooth flow.   

Next, three consecutive days of ‚ÄúJDE Demand Workshop‚Äù took place with the attendance of EMC tech heads, finance team, Emergn and JDE Centre of Excellence from UK. Three day workshop, drew a crystal clear picture of the importance of VFQ principles, why it is the right choice to deliver the most value frequently and how the newly developed Agile team will function to deploy demands from a business prioritized list.  

After JDE Workshop concluded, EMC Tech Heads meeting resumed on Friday with updates on the innovative ‚ÄúCTC Order Intelligence‚Äù project. As one of the first prominent examples of reinventing the pharma‚Äôs business with full utilization of technology and innovation, this project has reached the pilot phase in Pakistan, Turkey and Argentina. GCC Tech Head, Rachid Zenouaki emphasized the expectations from the project and added the vision of integration of commercial channels through further deployment of ecommerce and CTC platforms.   

Next, Director of Frontline Operations, Sarah Jones met with the Tech Heads for the first time after taking over EMEA role. Her core message that the recent EIS->Tech Ops reorganization did not imply a simple name change but fundamentally structured the organization along strategic priorities and clarified how Frontline Operations and Pharma Tech collaboration will extend into coming years.   EM VP Pharma Tech, Kevin Li  took the next slot utilizing the new Immersive VTC technology in Istanbul & Singapore. The warm feeling like sitting in the same room triggered questions to Kevin from the team and he shared EM news, gave inspiring feedback to the team and reminded all about EM priorities. 

Next on the agenda was presentation of action plans to improve our scores on the GSK Survey pertaining to questions 23 & 24. Each market shared their GEMBA‚Äôs observations, specific action plans and inspired each other to take additional measures based on commonalities identified. #makingiteasier

The last activity of the day was a practical session of feedback as a G.I.F.T. led by an external consultancy. The team refreshed effective feedback principles, held rapid feedback sessions with each other and blended it all within the new GSK Expectations of courage, accountability, teamwork and development.   

At night, beautiful Istanbul weather enhanced the pleasure of a sailing activity on the waters of Bosphorus. Two teams raced each other to win a sailing cup while working their collaborative muscles on the boats.   Team met on Saturday to conclude the workshop with the vital topic of innovation. Presentations from each market, summarizing real life samples of innovations started lighting up new ideas all around. More importantly, everybody contributed to a list of innovation enablers and blockers so that enablers could be strengthened while disablers terminated.   

After six long consecutive days of fully packed workshops, the team proved their resilience by ending on the high note of ‚ÄúTalent Review‚Äù session.

639,2,10/07/2018,18,"Here is the presentation I did for GSK Tech Brazil strategic meeting based on ""Innovation beyond the comfort zone"" report by The Economist Intelligence Unit. It was a high level discussion about what is and how to boost innovation in our day by day activities.
Thanks Vania Neves for this opportunity. 

Highlights  

Getting out of one‚Äôs comfort zone is necessary in order to survive and lead the change. With a focus on true innovation, combined with precise brand strategies, companies cannot only master disruption but drive it in order to create sustainable competitive advantage.  

üí°Being comfortable is not an option!  

Brands that do not address friction points early enough risk becoming obsolete once someone else addresses them in a consequential and different way.  
Friction points are parameters that make the life of consumers less comfortable, less convenient or less efficient. Addressing them provides an opportunity for business-model innovation.  
Only being new does not mean that something is an innovation.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Innovation makes the lives of customers perceptibly easier.",Eric Gallardo uploaded a file.,1932,0,13:46,0
