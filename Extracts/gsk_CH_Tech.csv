0,2,21/12/2018,57,"I wanted to take the time to update you on appointing leaders into the new R&D Tech Leadership Team structure, with the appointment of Michel Rider, who will join as the VP of Clinical Solutions, based in Upper Providence.  In her role, Michel will lead a team who will provide technology solutions to clinical operations, data management and biostatistics, and R&D portfolio management and will partner with the Clinical Development and Portfolio Management leadership teams in R&D.    Michel will be joining on 16 January 2019. Michel comes to us from Accenture, with prior experiences at Merck and in academic research.  Michel worked as a bench researcher in academia, gaining valuable knowledge of R&D, acquiring and preparing data to answer questions and contributing knowledge to the scientific community. At Merck, Michel's roles spanned from technical business analysis to R&D portfolio management. At Accenture, she recently served as the Managing Director responsible for Accenture‚Äôs Life Science Cloud products and offerings (currently used by GSK Data Management team members). Michel has a deep understanding of intelligent automation (e.g. AI, RPA) and technology enablement of the clinical development process.     Michel graduated from Michigan State University with a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology and earned a Master of Science in Management of Information Systems from Steven‚Äôs Institute of Technology.    Michel‚Äôs previous roles have prepared her to swiftly deliver our technology portfolio in Clinical Development and Portfolio Management, and lead our organizational transition to Product Orientation and DevOps.    
I also wanted to take the time and update you on the current R&D Tech Leadership Team.  Adrian Cottrell, Ben Langley, and Richard Young will be leaving GSK in 2019.  They will support the transition within R&D Tech during the first half of 2019.  I look forward to their continued leadership and guidance as we transition to the new R&D Tech structure. I would like to thank Adrian, Ben, and Richard Young for their many years of service at GSK.    
Adrian joined GSK 30 years ago, as analyst programmer, after completing his PhD in Physical Chemistry. During his career at GSK, Adrian has delivered a range of R&D solutions including Pharmacokinetics analysis solutions, Clinical Trial Management System (eTrack) and R&D Core Financials (Hyperion). Broader GSK solution deliveries include, single GSK Adverse Event Management (OASIS), electronic Trial Master File (eTMF), OnePharma for Medical Information management (MIND) and ¬£30M funding for the GSK Regulatory Transformation (Veeva RIM). Additionally, Adrian collaborated with external partners to deliver automated clinical data management through the ALSC Consortium. He also played key roles in M&A activities (e.g., Novartis with both the Oncology divestment and the ingestion of Vaccine & Consumer Health R&D data) and defined the Tech roadmap to integrate GSK Japan with broader R&D. Adrian has recently driven the adoption of high performance computing (HPC) to enable Clinical Biostatistics & Predictive Modelling and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to lower operating costs for Clinical and Pharmacovigilance.    
Ben joined GSK 25 years ago as an IT graduate. He started with the Help Desk Services team, going on to run a Collaborative Technologies function, introducing R&D to instant messaging, screen sharing, and meeting management tools. He worked on several, ""once in a lifetime"" projects, including Tech delivery for the London 2012 Olympics Anti-Doping Lab facility. Over the past 6 years Ben has led a diverse team partnering with R&D Japan, China, and Finance & Portfolio Management as well as driving R&D Tech Innovation, UX and maximizing value from our published information and archives. On a personal note, Ben remarked, ‚ÄúI am proud of what I have helped Tech accomplish and can see more great opportunities to come. It's been a tough decision to part ways with GSK, but it is now time to focus on my family and pursue some different adventures. I feel lucky to have worked with some truly amazing people.‚Äù    
Richard has worked at GSK for 27 years, starting as a Support Manager in the Preclinical domain, and having a variety of roles including Strategic Partner to Chemical Development, Programme Manager, Delivery Director for Discovery, Development and Lab Systems and finally, heading up Systems Delivery and Support. In these roles, Richard lead the R&D programme that set up the Poznan Competency Centres, delivered the Simplify Clinical Development Programme resulting in ¬£60M per annum benefits, delivered many new capabilities to R&D, as well as leading pervious transformations of R&D IT and working closely with our outsources supplier to provide services to R&D.    
Please join me in welcoming Michel and thanking and wishing Adrian, Ben, and Richard much success in their future endeavours. ",Mike Montello is with Mark Buswell and 4 others.,517,8,12:54,0

Bulk loader ‚Äì a success story By Laura Turton CDO
The Bulk Loader tool went live in April 2018 and was scheduled to import 18 migration studies from PhlexGlobal. From July, a total of 226,788 artefacts were imported into Pharma TMF enabling studies to achieve their migration end date to meet MHRA commitments. Besides boosting migration completion, this represented a cost avoidance of ¬£907,152 compared to manually importing using TCS. It has been a challenging project at times but the dedication of the CDO and R&D Techteam has shone through to result in this great achievement. With the learnings and experience gained this year we are confident that the Bulk Loader will be a huge help to process artefacts returned from other vendors in 2019

IDMP (Identification of Medicinal Products) is a set of ISO standards for global specification of medicinal products, foundational for Falsified Medicines and Patient Safety Signal Detection. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is first to implement IDMP for Authorized Product and Substance data, covering ~7000 of GSK registrations.
Led by R&D Tech and in partnership with Rx, Cx and Vx BUs and Tech teams, 2 phases of the programme have reduced compliance and operational risks via:
‚Ä¢ Establishment of GSK Data Governance for EMA Referential and Organization data which aligned processes across Rx, Cx and Vx and is supported by a Global SOP and eLearning;
‚Ä¢ Advancement of the EMA Product Data Asset Readiness from 30% average across BUs to over 80%; EMA Substance data asset was advanced to over 90% across three BUs;
‚Ä¢ Implementation of an end to end Automation for selected EMA controlled vocabularies ensuring consistency between GSK and EMA and leveraging R&D Master Data Management (MDM) system. Cx Regulatory system is the first consumer of the data.
Going forward, IDMP capability will be realized via Regulatory Information Management Platform delivered by Regulatory Processes and System Programme (RPS)
IDMP is an example of successful collaboration amongst 3 BUs and their Tech partners. A BIG NOTE OF THANKS to the entire enterprise team for their valuable contributions!

It's apparent that R&D Tech has embraced agile ways of working (great to see the use of the surface hubs and performing a virtual BRP from Upper Providence and Stevenage Innovation Centers - see screen shot below of virtual stickies). The BRP was focused on a subset of our priorities and was a good MVP to run the planning session. Technology solutions for enabling R&D to discovery and develop biopharma products, streamlining Regulatory, and enabling the management of the Portfolio were selected, which are key priorities for R&D next year. We'll continue to improve how we plan releases as we continue the agile journey, and include full scope into our planning.
It's a great time to be in Pharma R&D Tech, with the new R&D approach and fascinating science with curative potential, new collaborations giving us access to rich data, and the most advanced information technology including our hybrid cloud that will power AI/ML advanced analytics. I really look forward to continuously improving R&D Tech to help enable the R&D strategy which will create many challenging opportunities for our team and as individuals.
Although I was only here for part of 2018, I do feel the contribution you have all made and the contributions are significant across the end to end process of finding and developing medicines. Thank you for those contributions throughout the year, the systems that underpin R&D are enhanced and supported by you all and the contribution is significant.
I hope everyone has the time to take a breather and to spend time with your families and friends (and pets, as I see we have a lot of them from Pets at GSK). And as individuals, reflect on the transformation and opportunities that such change creates. Looking forward to seizing opportunity and continuing to progress in 2019!

Ok set aside a few minutes to read this while you struggle with that really important end of year Workday task .. I will only say this once üôÇ You will need to read to the end!!!
So all of you already know that the Java SE 8 client will become a paid option from March 2019 if you want support, right? This means those folks supporting applications which have a dependency on Java 8 or ANY other legacy version (7 or 6) will need to, if you havent already, produce an approved RISK exception in RMS or stump up the ¬£cash$. The risk is probably graded as LOW for internal apps and MEDIUM for External apps but you should do the analysis and confirm.  You MUST do this before January 21st 2019.
I have attached the Excel application list to name the possible 62 applications.
So this was the easy part...

1) You will also have to provide an application MUD ID user list for your Java dependent application before January 21st 2019 and append that list to your RISK.  Please also send this list to Tim Smithies and Pravin Banthia
2) You should also provide user list updates every 2 weeks from February 2019 if there are any changes. This will ensure that beyond March 2019 we dont get any friendly fire removals of Java 8. People get very upset you know...
3) Any application which uses Java 8 after March 2019 will only be able to obtain it from AIT (the legitimate route) if you have that approved Risk and user list in place or you are paying for it.
4) If your application has any AIT installation component then you should ensure there is a precursor check and Java 8 should be bundled as part of the installation. Contact the scripting service for help on this. As usual the Documentum apps are proving a challenge to plan and support.

When its a VITRUAL GSK Windows 10 build... sillyüòÉ
You should know by now that the latest Windows 10 E5 build, hot off the press as of last week, is available for your delectation.
However apart from all the latest updates and tweaks you should be aware of a couple of things. Getting the builds to work for T4 and vPC builds has been a real pa** .. sorry.. challenge as there are some new features which require the upgrade of the underlying ESx or Citrix platforms. Thats why its taken a little longer to get the new virtual machines for testing.
Technically some BIOS security features required by the Windows 10 E5 desktop builds were not available for vPC builds under the older ESx versions (anything less than 6.7).  So... we had to update that before we could get a *good* quality approved vPC or T4 Win 10 build.
Secondly and more importantly in the latest Win 10 release there are a number of new security feature updates (aka removal of support for some risky legacy stuff like NTLMv1 see my previous post) . However because vPC's are built without some of these security features enabled you could be be lulled into a warm cosy feeling when your application passes Win 10 testing. Yay!!  But BEWARE, the same application may fail on a real persons computer, your physical laptop!
So the moral of this story is... Always, Always, Always if you suspect something maybe a bit dodgy (technical term) with your application, test on both platforms.

Researchers can filter for studies that have results posted and even see if individual patient data is available for research use.
The new site also allows patients to search and filter over 7000 studies by condition, status and location to e.g. find studies for their condition that are recruiting near them and it even includes a handy map!

Things are changing .. again üôÇ.... Java is moving forwards into a mix of Open Java and Oracle Java. The latter will become a subscription based model so you will need to consider which lifecycle path you choose. GSK Core platforms will provide support for the most current version only in stepped 6 monthly releases on the Windows 10 desktop. There is however the option to join a Long Term Support stream (LTS) of which Java 11 is one. Beyond the first 6 months of each release support automatically transfers into the community unless you subscribe.
Application owners will become responsible for their own Java JDK if they can't keep pace with the rate of change or they are locked into a vendor specific version.
Make sure you talk to your vendors and make sure you plan for regular changes in the JDK in GSK or pay for your LTS stream like Oracle Java 11
This also applies to both the desktop and servers, its the same JDK.

Another vulnerability to wet your appetites and make you wonder who actually spends time working out these loopholes.
This one is childishly simple to exploit and so its important you patch as soon as practically possible (internally it should be on our regular patch cycle). The vulnerability only exists if you use tools dependent on the LIBSSH code. We also have a number of vendors who host solutions and applications for GSK that need to be contacted and ask what they are doing to remediate the problem and when they will fix it.
I will be sending an email to those owners of SaaS, IaaS, PaaS and OBA systems.
Internally you can do this as part of your regular patching cycles and is fixed by security patching the libssh libraries.

165,2,30/10/2018,10,Day 2 at Pharma R&D Informatics and AI Congress. John Baldoni kicked off with key note on the work of his in silico DPU. Key insight that I hadn‚Äôt appreciated versus the main R&D Technology Strategy is that John is focusing his efforts of applying machine learning post target selection - his DPU wants to transform the approach from target to impact on patient. This then differentiates with where the main R&D technology strategy is currently focused on Genetics and Genomics. Second up was a very interesting presentation from Eric Little from Osthus. Catch phrase was from big data to big analysis. He shared a semantic spectrum from weak semantics to strong semantics. Top of the spectrum is the application of ontologies. Bottom of the spectrum is simple lists that enable things like controlled vocabularies. He also contrasted data warehouses and data lakes - both of which have significant challenges. He suggested that the next trend was virtualisation whereby you leave data where it is and connect into meta-data. You then perform analysis where the data is rather than try and consolidate it into one place. I probably haven‚Äôt done justice to his talk but it was very thought provoking and I learnt a lot.,Mark Buswell,654,0,10:27,0

Attended an enjoyable and very productive workshop with my mhealth in Bournemouth last Wednesday. My mhealth provide an innovative digital solution for patients to manage their long term condition.  

GSK's real world study team are collaborating with my mhealth to identify suitable patients from their real world data sources to take part in GSK's Intrepid Trelegy Study.  The main driver for this collaboration is to speed up the Trelegy recruitment process by using real world data to expedite the generation of a targeted list of patients which can be forwarded to the Primary Investigator.  

Our Collaboration with my mhealth will help them deliver 3 key deliverables: 
A list of suitable patients for the PI to initiate and progress recruitment in Southampton. 
A new User Interface that will allow a more rapid querying of the my mhealth's data sources. 
Evidence in the form of documents that support their software development process.

it appears that if R&D wants to maintain any legacy versions we will have to provide our own support as platforms are trying to simplify and support only current versions of the desktop components and reduce costs.
This potentially creates a financial overhead going forwards if we were to stay with the current licensed Oracle Java SE stream. Read the information in this link.
The Windows 10 team is currently assessing the impact and will be looking at our options going forwards. Here is the link to the updated GSK Windows 10 build differences between 1709 and 1803

Joe Kelly, Timin Hadi and I attended the US Pistoia Conference in Boston last week. For those not familiar Pistoia it is a not-for-profit alliance for the reduction of barriers to innovation in Life Sciences, of which GSK is a founding member.
Highlights from the conference included a key note from Dr Jim Sullivan - VP Global Discovery at Abbvie, who talked about the emergence of new modalities, the role of AI and discussed Abbvie's strategy and the importance of a ""winning culture"". Definite echoes of the GSK R&D strategy of Science x Technology x Culture.
There was a quick overview of all the projects on-going - it was clear that GSK are generally engaged in projects, however it wasn't so clear how we were benefitting from or leveraging the outputs of projects. In some cases like User Exp for Life Sciences we have clearly leveraging through Simon Fortenbacher's UX work. However in other cases like Unified Data Model, FAIR Data Principles and AbVance it isn't as clear. For anyone more interested in all the Pistoia Projects check-out: https://ip3.pistoiaalliance.org/
A number of new member companies introduced themselves - one in particular, Avantor caught my eye - they purport to have worked with Google to create APIs for complex high content data sets.
Pistoia released the Life Sciences Innovation Report which they commissioned with Clarivate Analytics - this is pre-release to member companies only (see attached file).
Lastly the Pistoia President's Award Dragon's Den was held and the judges winner was Ryffin (who we are well aware of), whilst the popular vote went to BreastIT , which is an innovative approach to health screening in Uganda.
Overall conference was stimulating, the Pistoia Alliance is in good health, and it was a valuable networking opportunity.",Mark Buswell uploaded a file.,719,0,10:30,0

The next release of MS Office 2016 (r1808) is now available for testing and the project team has reviewed the changes. Most of the changes relate to bug fixes on the existing product and there are some very minor updates which appear to have NO or LOW potential impact. The summarised assessment is attached for your information. Testing guidance is available here on PAGE 6.
We are continuing to embed the office update activities into business as usual as part of maintaining our application currency and reducing our ongoing project spend.

The key recommendations are:-
No application testing required unless you have specific concerns which need to be verified
Change controls should only be raised for GxP Office dependent applications even if you do not test. You must raise a Change either way so that you document your risk assessment and testing decision
ALL dependent applications will be marked as WILL NOT TEST in the central tracker unless you respond to Pravin Banthia or Tim Smithies within 2 weeks by 5th October.

Most of our testing is now complete on Win 10 v1709 and we have shut down our internal testing teams except for those still in remediation activities. The next release is Win 10 v1803 but this comes with a twist... its actually being called v1803 E5 (I have no idea why.. perhaps some sort of Tech Platforms rebranding) There are some critical differences of note. See here for GSK details and here for MS information.
NO MORE Symantec üëèüëè Its being replaced by the MS equivalent security products including the SCCM deployment product from MS. PowerBroker is likely to go and SCCM for application elevation will replace it. Digital Guardian however is likely to stay.
So what does this mean?
Well ... no more testing for a while and in fact we wont do much until the E5 build is released (Perhaps October?). Our recommendation is that minimal retesting of a small subset of applications will be required (TBA) when that comes out.

Important to keep bigger perspective and focus on the positives...
...Extract from today‚Äôs VFQ insight (and link to sign up) below
We all know how important attitude is in our lives. Our ability to maintain a balanced perspective often makes the difference between reacting and responding to specific situations.
While perspective is important, as is remaining positive, there is still one other dimension of attitude that often goes unchecked - gratitude. This is something that can literally change how effective and impactful you become, especially in your work and day-to-day routine.
Gratitude is a deep-seeded belief. It‚Äôs an ongoing acknowledgement of thankfulness not entitlement. It‚Äôs an attitude that says I get to do this vs I have to do this.
As Thornton Wilder put it, ‚ÄúWe can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures.‚Äù
Consider
Studies on gratitude repeatedly show that it helps people perform exponentially better than those people that remain more neutral in their views.",Ben Langley shared a link.,852,0,07:47,0

332,0,23/08/2018,7,"REGULATORY INSPECTION READINESS
Are you responsible in some way for a GxP computer system(s) (Business System Owner, IT Service Specialist, Support, etc.)?  If so, are you inspection ready? Inspection Readiness is the state of being successfully prepared for a regulatory inspection at a moment‚Äôs notice, such that, ideally, there are no (or minimal, insignificant) inspection findings at the conclusion of the Inspection.  
Below is a real-world inspection scenario involving computer systems and it is happening now in GSK.
In preparation for the upcoming GSK GCP Process inspection, as part of the pre-inspection dossier, the MHRA has requested a listing of computer systems used in the conduct of clinical trials including the following information:
‚Ä¢ Computer System Name
‚Ä¢ What does it do? (e.g. TMF, CRF, IVRS etc.)
‚Ä¢ Off the Shelf or In House Developed?
‚Ä¢ System Supplier
‚Ä¢ Version number (for each version of the system released over the last 3 years or since the last MHRA inspection)
‚Ä¢ Installation Date
‚Ä¢ Validation status
‚Ä¢ Reason for Change
‚Ä¢ Who validated?
‚Ä¢ Server Host and Location
Do you, as a responsible person, have this information accurate, readily available, and at your fingertips so that it can be provided on short notice (i.e. within 24 hours)?  Do you have it for each version of the system even if you were not the one responsible for previous versions?  Is it documented somewhere where the collective information for all systems is readily available (e.g. System Inventory or registry) and can be readily updated as the information changes over time (e.g. new versions of the system)?
If you can answer ‚Äúyes‚Äù to the above questions, then you are (at least initially) likely on the ‚ÄúReady‚Äù end of the Inspection Readiness spectrum.
As we continue to ponder inspection readiness in light of the pre-inspection information requested, we can also now begin to speculate what other queries or requests could be made once the inspectors arrive on site and begin the inspection proper (e.g. evidence of validation such as validation reports or testing documentation, evidence of training for those responsible for or involved in the validation of the systems, lists of change controls, evidence of supplier, service provider, and/or host management, associated SOPs, etc.).
Each inspection is unique and we cannot predict with certainty the direction any one inspection or inspector will go with regard to computer systems queries or requests but being inspection ready is understanding what is required and expected and what directions are possible then being prepared even if the queries or requests never materialize.",Bill McDonald,866,0,17:30,0

Your challenge: Connect with at least one person in One Pharma Tech who is not in your organization.
Guidelines to help you be successful in your mission:
‚Ä¢Choose someone who may be working on something similar, someone you may learn from or someone who may be working on something that interests you. Aim to connect with someone you have never talked to before.
‚Ä¢Not sure who to talk to?  Create a post in this Workplace group. Post the topics you are interested in learning about or describe your projects and skillset and offer to talk with people who might be interested in reaching out to you.
‚Ä¢Make this part of your development plan.  Learning from others is an important part of development. With the 70/20/10 approach, 20% of your development should be through other people (conversations, networks, relationships, asking questions of the right people).
Sharing successes:
‚Ä¢If you demonstrate a cross-boundary collaboration success, you are encouraged to share your experience in this Workplace group.
After this challenge:
‚Ä¢Don‚Äôt just limit yourself to one connection. This challenge will get you thinking about including learning from others as a natural way of working. Continue connecting!

Introducing CAPERS
The feature is called a Calendar-Aware Proactive Email Recommender System (CAPERS). While the acronym is a mouthful, the concept is simple: Outlook understands meetings and their context well enough to recommend the key emails that might help someone plan for a meeting. Using AI, CAPERS proactively selects and recommends potentially useful emails to users based on their upcoming calendar events, with a particular focus on meeting preparation.
Recommendation engines must accurately predict what people will want and need. AI can make the workflow of meeting preparation more productive, because it can predict which emails would actually help one prepare for a meeting. There is a relationship between content (email), location and time (calendar) that can be measured, and AI can identify those relationships with the highest predicted usefulness.",Bob Sutterley,986,0,22:07,0

‚Ä¢ Eye tracking ‚Äì A UX technology that allows R&D Tech to visualise where end users are looking on the screen during Usability Testing. This provides insight to where key functions are located, enabling R&D Tech to improve screen layouts, making them easier to read.
‚Ä¢ User interviews ‚Äì R&D Tech will sit 1x1 with an end user to understand more about their goals, expectations and how they go about their day-to-day jobs.
‚Ä¢ User observation ‚Äì An audio visual (AV) room that allows IT experts to watch users during UX activities and gain a better understanding of how to make IT systems easier to use.
‚Ä¢ User presentations ‚Äì A space for R&D Tech to demo new tools and technologies
‚Ä¢ Focus groups ‚Äì A collaboration space to discuss the needs and expectations with R&D user communities
