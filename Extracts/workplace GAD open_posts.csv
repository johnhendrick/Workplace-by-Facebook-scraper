4,4,19 12 2018,19,"Agile/VFQ and ICT... Less than 6 months ago very few would have thought this could work.
Let's see where we are now and what we have achieved in less than 4 months
Delivered to production:
- A tool to delete released Standard/Group costs
- A tool to delete Standard/Group costs which are not released (and 2 subsequent increments to enhance its functionality)
- A major enhancement to the multiplant report
- 4 fixes to pre-existing issues in the multiplant report (in two subsequent releases)
But there is more... 
- 7 additional functionalities are in Formal, ready to be released in Production in January.
If we look at the above results as if we were in the old world, this sounds like saying 12 STPs (proper ones, requiring updates of BPSDs etc.) and 4 Remedy tickets. All with a team of 4 functional, 4/5 technical consultants and 2 business people. üò≥üò≥
This has not been all smooth sailing... We have faced a number of challenges:
- inside the team, to get used to the new methodology and way of working
- outside the team, as the agile transformation was happening at different paces in the different teams
We have tackled them one after another, with an open and positive mind and with the support of our scrum master, our coaches and senior members from the LT.
And starting from November we have seen an improvement in the throughput, with a constant flow of problem statements moving from the inception to the delivery in production, without major blockages.
An example? One of the above enhancements has been started on Tuesday morning and deployed to production on Thursday evening (including SR/DS/SCRR and test case update). Not bad... and that was not the only one!üëç
All this to say we finally see the benefits of having transitioned to the Agile/VFQ model. 
After the initial phase, when everything seemed to move slower, we are now delivering at a much faster pace than in the past. And we would never go back!
Thanks to everyone in the team for the hard work and the excellent results achieved. Let's all enjoy the upcoming holiday period with our families, rest and recharge for a 2019 which will be even more productive!",Max Lamagna is feeling thankful with Tapodipta Khan and 11 others.,454,4,12:55,0,Wed,0.059471366
5,0,31 07 2018,15,"GA&D's strategy for reporting tools (*1) recognises that in this area software offerings are evolving rapidly. One of our underlying architectural principles is to manage our datasets to be tool agnostic so that different reporting tools can be applied over time either as the technology or business preference changes.
This approach is being put to the test as we see increased interest and adoption of Qlik, PowerBI, R and SAP Lumira (*2).
As we deploy new technologies, our aim is to be agile, to learn from a combination of industry evaluations, strategic partnerships, GSK pilots & GSK customer feedback so we ascertain which solutions drive the most business benefit. We will be prepared to scale where we see early success, or to fail-fast when we agree that business benefit is not fully realised.
It can be confusing to know which reporting tool to use when - each has it's own strenghts and following; GAD's Analytics and BI team are compiling a reporting tool framework to help explain key features, aligned to user personas, and reporting and analytic use-cases so that it's easier to evaluate the business value that each tool can bring. This will complement our existing business intelligence governance framework so we use the most appropriate delivery model to deliver value fast using a mixture of Tech and business-led report building expertise.

VFQ Daily Insight - A team mission
Ken Kocienda boiled down the Apple product development process and culture into a single paragraph. He describes it as:
A small group of passionate, talented, imaginative, ingenious, ever-curious people built a work culture based on applying their inspiration and collaboration with diligence, craft, decisiveness, taste, and empathy and, through a lengthy progression of demo-feedback sessions, repeatedly tuned and optimized heuristics and algorithms, persisted through doubts and setbacks, selected the most promising bits of progress at every step, all with the goal of creating the best products possible.

VFQ Daily Insight - Is your message coming through loud and clear?
There have been times where a colleague and I have both read the same email and each had completely different interpretations. We'd both filled in the gaps and drawn conclusions based on our past experiences, our relationship with the writer, and even our mood at that particular moment.
As we write in our Communication, Collaboration and Coordination book, communication is made up of both sender and receiver. In a group who have worked together for a long time, due to their shared history, the receivers are more likely to understand the same thing, even when much is left unsaid. In a growing organization or a new team, the plurality of experiences means that this is far from guaranteed and the risk of misunderstandings much higher. When being aligned is such a big part of being successful, we can't underestimate the importance of clarity in how we communicate.

How competitive are you? According to Marshall Goldsmith, one of the best known executive coaches, we‚Äôre so competitive that we have prove how much more miserable we are than others.

VFQ Daily Insight - 12th man
Organizations often place a significant emphasis on process and methodologies when trying to create high performing teams. However, we often overlook a highly visible, but somehow invisible element that can impact the flow and quality of work. That element is the workspace.
In a recent Emerging World of Work podcast, Guillaume Alvarez the SVP for EMEA, Steelcase talked about how the office space can impact how a team comes together to achieve great things. The workspace can be used to galvanize, to strengthen and inspire the team, just as in American Football the crowd of the home team often acts as the 12th player.

VFQ Daily Insight - At odds with our values
Why doesn‚Äôt change stick as well as we‚Äôd like in our teams and organizations? Why is it so much easier to pay lip service and tell others what they want to hear but then we don‚Äôt seem to be motivated or interested enough in advancing the cause?
Gary Hamel recently shared that unless organizations stop operating at odds with their stated values and surrender their own interests to the support the status quo, that meaningful change simply won‚Äôt happen. Gary argued, through statistics, anecdotes and credible examples, that the status quo is definitely the path of least resistance and that many simply don‚Äôt want to take or make the hard journey of change.

The target is to provide the business with real-time scenario planning and analytics that will maximise our integrated supply chains. We have recently piloted IBP for Scenario Planning using requirements from Pharma, which coupled with a similar pilot in Vaccines, provide a great opportunity to develop this further as a solution for GSK. The initial feedback from both pilots have been encouraging with the Vaccines business looking to implement IBP for Scenario Planning for the Shingrix supply chain in 2019. As an SAP solution, IBP provides the inherent benefits of an integrated system i.e. fully aligned master and transactional data, with the broader ERP solution and that used in Vaccines. Hence the potential of real time planning and analytics can be realised across Pharma, Vaccines and Consumer supply chains. Using IBP for Scenario Planning enables us to take a key step forward to meeting those business requirements and the opportunity to build on the successes of ERP and the benefits of a fully integrated solution across Commercial and Manufacturing.

VFQ Daily Insight - Enabling people to learn
A recent study into the Finnish education system show that their model enables teachers and students to learn. Purpose built, acoustically sensitive spaces have been constructed for several classes of children and multiple teachers to come together to create a shared learning experience. The children have a choice about working with their peers or being taught by the teachers and they have a mixture of subject and skills-based learning to choose from. The teachers trust the children with the task in hand and believe that the by giving the children the responsibility of their own learning, provides more motivation and self-regulation. The teachers acknowledge that this operating culture only works with commitment from the whole school community.
Traditionally, we often feel we need to learn from an expert. However, this skills and theory blend of self-discovery learning has this interesting link with driving motivation. In this environment we have multiple ‚Äòexperts‚Äô being able to co-facilitate to aid their own learning and students able to choose how they learn, whom they learn with and what they learn. This trust and choice offered to the teachers and students drives motivation, focus and positivity, leading to a better quality learning experience for all.

Rather than teaching people the answers, how can you enable them to experiment and self-discover their own learning?",Natasha Bennett shared a post.,383,0,09:00,0,Fri,0

Spending time reflecting on last week‚Äôs Tech Let‚Äôs Talk and discussing with many in the broader Tech organisation , perhaps I can share some thoughts with you
I acknowledge the feedback from last week was real and painful. However, It is better to get it out in the open so we can address the concerns and really understand the state of our teams.
The feedback had full range of anger, sense of low engagement , people not feeling valued and also some excitement about the change and very good clarifying Questions on our Tech Transformation. We hear you!
The speed of change in GSK, Tech and our Industry continues to accelerate. GSK IPT, Tech Transformation , investment in DDA , reconstruction of R&D, 23 and Me, Cx buyout of NVS, all new since mid 2017. GSK is pivoting, Tech needs to transform, building on past successes to enable Speed to Value and enable a more Science/ Tech based company. This is not easy.
GA&D have had a big impact in 2018 and Your commitment, Your high degree of accountability and Your demonstrated courage to deliver significant value during a time of change within GA&D has been very impressive in 2018. Thank You !
Taking on board this feedback , perhaps my focus in 2019 will be:
1) Continue to Develop our People and Communicate / Engage more
People are our greatest asset. Motivate, Inspire and Develop our people, will be a key focus for me in 2019. Let‚Äôs all assume positive intent of each other and I will listen more actively and engage more deeply. Hold me accountable at January Townhall to discuss plans for GA&D Investment in more VFQ teams and your development in new Tech skills building on our outstanding Tech expertise
2) Teamwork across Tech
Investing more time and energy to reconnect with other Tech Teams will be important in 2019. We in GA&D have been delivering Waves of change for years, now time to reconnect and actively collaborate across Tech
Teamwork with the rest of Tech organisations will be my focus in 2019. Teamwork is a force multiplier and will create a bigger sense of OneTechTeam independent of the the organisation you live. As we Transform, we all need to be in it together to support each other

VFQ Daily Insight - Feedback flutter
About 15 years ago, I was close to boarding a trans-Atlantic flight, browsing in a store for some books to read on the way. My eye caught a cover which had a panda up a ladder, armed with a paintbrush dipped in red paint, correcting the title. I scanned the title, paused, then read it again. With a grin on my face I turned to the back cover where I found a joke. It was about the title and explained perfectly what was going on. You see, the panda on the front cover didn't want to be the panda from the joke. The difference between them? A comma. Well, at least visually. As to its meaning, that comma turned a peaceful creature into a violent perpetrator, maybe even a murderer. The book was Eats, Shoots & Leaves by Lynne Truss; a lighthearted guide to punctuation. (The current edition seems to have lost the back-cover joke but you can still find it quite easily on the Net.)
As much as I'd recommend the book to anyone wishing to improve their punctuation in English, it isn't the point I'd like to make. (Get it?) What actually struck me back then is how sometimes a small detail can make a big difference. For good, or bad. It struck me because I was also reading about chaos at the time. In Chaos Theory, the butterfly effect describes a situation where, within a particular system, one can observe vastly different outcomes due to very small, seemingly unconnected changes. Which brings me to experiments and feedback.
The purpose of an experiment is to generate learning about the nature of a system or environment, based on some hypotheses, assumptions, and previous learning. When applied within product development, experiments aim to validate our guesses as to how (or how well) products or services work within our business model. Most of the time there is an underlying and unstated assumption that we're not dealing with chaotic scenarios. Yet, there's always a possibility that we are. How would we know? We can look at the feedback. Significant variations in results would be an indicator of potentially chaotic behavior which, in turn, should influence how we would proceed with shaping solutions to our customers' problems.
Consider
 Is running your experiment only once enough to draw reliable conclusions? Can you think of small changes in the parameters of an experiment which might produce different outcomes? Would it be worth testing these variations? Could you harness the power of digital simulation to explore faster and cheaper?",Natasha Bennett shared a post.,534,0,09:02,0,Mon,0

VFQ Daily Insight - Empathy
Apple knows how to build products that people love. In order to accomplish that, they use empathy to learn a lot about their users. They don‚Äôt always take the ideas or solutions of their customers or users, but they do listen intently to the problems being described. There is a difference between implementing the solutions suggested and deeply understanding the problems being described. Knowing the problems and the questions that need answering is the start of a design process that can lead to compelling solutions.
Ken Kocienda describes empathy as ‚ÄúTrying to see the world from other people‚Äôs perspectives and creating work that fits into their lives and adapts to their needs‚Äù. Today, it‚Äôs common to see techniques like this being used in start-ups and in organizations who are leaders in product development, but it‚Äôs still quite rare to see these techniques when we consider organizational change or other enterprise endeavors.
Organizational change requires a deep understanding of the problems our employees, teams and suppliers have. We shouldn‚Äôt stop our development process until we have solved the problems. Solving these will equip our own people to better serve customers.

Does your development process focus on developing and delivering solutions or deeply understanding and designing ways to solve problems?",Natasha Bennett shared a post.,524,0,09:08,0,Fri,0

Here is a quick overview of the Bots delivered last week:  
Trintech Cadency Backup Upload ‚Äì 3 Replicants
The Genpact RPA delivery team continues to add to the overall total with 3 Trintech ‚ÄòReplicant‚Äô BOTs for the ANZ, UK, and NA regions.  These Bots leverage the work done on the master bot that extracts supporting documents from Trintech and uploads them into SAP. These documents provide evidence and rational for the manual journal entries in SAP, supporting audit requirements and SOX controls.  
CSI Month End -TVARVC Table 
The Posting Period Management for Financial & Material management is a critical activity - if this activity is missed or if there are any incorrect values entered, the production systems may be prevented from any postings that having a financial impact/document. To mitigate the risk of incorrect or missed manual updates, this Bot automates the process on the agreed/published month-end schedule.  
SMAS Month End - Manufacturing Variance (Sprint 1) 
This process is performed by SMAS analysts in EMEA, KL & US on WD1-2 for each SMAS site. Activity is required because the production variances aren't automatically split by SAP.  This Bots removed manual effort and removes potential blockers to month-end close.  
Promo GMM Creation to Canada Upgrade
GMM set-up for promotional materials is a highly manual  process with most of the required fields for set-up being static data with repetitive data entry. This Bot has been working successfully in production, but needed to be upgraded in order to align with new features available in the Nov 2018 CERPs Patching Release.  
O2C Order Line Cancellation (US and CA) 
This Bot provides the US and CA businesses an automated method the cancel order line items that will not be fulfilled, which needs to happen in instances where a material is in short supply or otherwise unavailable to the customer.  The automation enables customer service to reduce /eliminate non-value-added tasks to address orders that will not be fulfilled and an expedited review and resolution to these open items.  Additionally, the automated process ensures consistent information flow to SCP related to true demand and provides more clarity in reporting for Finance.  
HCP Decision Engine Reconciliation Bot
This Bot is utilized to reconcile the Decision Engine data across systems and to send a report to business owners with the record counts. This activity is performed on daily basis, and executes for approximately 30 minutes.  The Bot logs into SAP ECC and BW and navigate across different sessions, copying the number record counts from each table and paste in excel log, then sending the report to the TDOR team.",Al Washco is with John Johnston and 12 others.,687,4,20:21,0,Mon,0.065502183

VFQ Daily Insight - The ground is flat
You might not actually hear someone say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my job‚Äù, but sometimes people behave in such a way that this statement is clearly communicated. It‚Äôs likely we wouldn‚Äôt admit that we see some jobs to be done as beneath us, but it‚Äôs also likely that we do indeed see some tasks in that light.
The business community talks a lot about servant leaders, but how does that play out practically? I love the old story of the American news reporter that came to England in the 1800‚Äôs to see the famous preacher, Charles Spurgeon, whose reputation had reached American shores. The reporter arrived early at Metropolitan Tabernacle to find no one there yet, other than a man sweeping the front steps to get the place ready for the service.
The reporter was told to come back in an hour, which he did and made his way to the front to get a good seat and to ensure he could see Spurgeon after for an interview. When the service started, the reporter was astonished to see that Spurgeon was the man he met earlier outside sweeping the steps.

VFQ Daily Insight - Giving and taking
One of the more interesting books I‚Äôve read is the Paradox of Generosity by Christian Smith and Hilary Davidson. The authors make the point that people who are generous in giving their time and resources experience better outcomes. They also point out that few people are actually generous and tend to hold on to things without ever really considering how or why they would share more openly.
Generosity is actually a paradox when it exists in relationships, especially in business. The risk of giving is that the person receiving will eventually stop being grateful and may even expect more as an entitlement.
I believe that generosity is a soft skill we need to practice more, even at the risk of others becoming ungrateful. The idea of building high performing organizations starts with clear direction and open communication, but it is also supported by leaders who give and share.
Consider
 Let‚Äôs be different and better in how we look after our organizations. Generosity is wrong only if the motivation behind it is based on what we get from giving.",Natasha Bennett shared a post.,550,0,11:43,0,Wed,0.003636364

VFQ Daily Insight - Truth isn't optional
Many years ago, when I started in business, I was fortunate to have people around me that took the time to mentor and teach me. Some of the most important lessons learned along the way came in those early years.
I remember one of my mentors saying, ‚ÄúAlways tell the truth, because you‚Äôll never forget what you said.‚Äù This was his way of sharing two important principles.
First, the truth about a situation is what it is and when everyone knows what that is, it becomes more straightforward to manage.
Second, the truth allows us to respond sooner and better. When a program isn‚Äôt performing or the numbers aren‚Äôt where they need to be, it‚Äôs important to know sooner and make adjustments.
We see this approach in sports more easily where the numbers don‚Äôt lie - you‚Äôre either winning or losing and the best teams have learned to make necessary adjustments along the way for the simple purpose of winning.

VFQ Daily Insight - No news isn't always good news
How many times have you asked for feedback on an idea or a piece of work and not heard anything back? It's tempting to interpret this silence as a sign that everything is fine as it is, especially when a deadline is looming. However, this can be a dangerous assumption to make. You may have asked the wrong question, have asked the wrong people, or maybe those people were just too busy. A vague request sent to everyone in your department is usually not the most effective way of getting feedback.
In our VFQ Foundations course, we talk about the importance of feedback and the impact it has on the quality of output. One of the points we address is that not all feedback systems are equal when it comes to the learning you can get from them.

We have built a new product and platform giving Invoice and Delivery status to Pharmacies. We are currently ramping up with customers in Spain and it is now being requested in Q1 by a 2nd Market Italy
We spent the first 5-6 months of year setting up the platform and choosing the right supplier and changing our approach with VFQ.
Once we got going using VFQ in June we delivered in 4 1/2 months using a true MVP approach. In the old GSK world we would have built something a lot more complicated and not delivered in that timescale.
We are yet to see the full value yet as we have not yet built ordering on the e-commerce platform (our ask for Q1) as we did a MVP approach by focusing on our customer current pain points. But have delivered some value early.
We have had really good collaboration between GA&D and CH Tech and built the foundations of a team to deliver more in 2019. Well done Vanessa Humphries, Sushma Swamy your collaboration is key to deliver the future roadmap.
My key lesson learnt is if we had started using VFQ  at start of the year (the approach had not yet been decided at this point), I think we would have got a small team together to get an MVP in place as quickly as possible rather than doing all the set up activities first.

VFQ Daily Insight - Company person
Perhaps it‚Äôs not the most correct phrase to use these days, but I believe most people know what‚Äôs meant when I say  ‚Äúcompany man‚Äù. This term infers that someone is committed to the organization and has the company‚Äôs best interests in mind.
This is, of course, what any employer desires from their employees. There is a hidden or unspoken challenge with this however. There is something beyond being a company person and that‚Äôs just being a good person in business, someone who is reliable.
There are two dangers we must monitor as we lead teams and organizations or work within them; being myopic and being selfish. When we‚Äôre myopic, we are seeing things only through our own filter and that can be risky as it can alter the truth of a situation, which might be what we want, but ultimately isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs best for everyone.
When we‚Äôre selfish, we stop celebrating the good news of the company and of others because we‚Äôre not getting the credit, notoriety, or attention we think we deserve. Certainly there are cases when these emotions might make sense, but here we‚Äôre discussing the bigger picture of how we behave generally.

VFQ Daily Insight - Speak their language
We were in the middle of a transformation piece with a client and had several sessions and workshops for the implementation of some new ways of working. It was during one of them that I came to a profound realization. I was dazzled by how simple it was to make someone understand something somewhat complex and new. You just have to speak their language.
‚ÄòWhy should we do that? We‚Äôve tried it again, what would be different this time around?‚Äô You can offer them all the rational, technical, detailed explanation in the world, but unless you view the world from their eyes, nothing will stick.
We are about 7.7 billion people in the world, speaking 6500 different languages. If you‚Äôre supporting any change initiative in today‚Äôs digital world, you‚Äôll probably come across people speaking some programming language too, and there are hundreds of them.

This Bot continues to build on improvements and reducing risk in the SMAS Month End reporting process by downloading Purchase Price Variance report for the plants supported by Supply Chain, preparing the Journals for Cadency and then posting in Cadency. The Bot will also send a summary report to the finance and manufacturing site contact. 

CDC Stock Pile Process (US Supply Chain and Distribution)
This Bot automates the process to the update the expiry date for all vaccine batches included on the CDC stockpile report based on the latest stock movement. The Bot logs into SAP EC, read Material numbers from Excel file and update SAP, then updates the log file accordingly with results from SAP & send email with reports attached to the business user. This process eliminates the risk of missing out blank batch names and updates batch names with entities and processes 5-6 entire per day.

Canada & US Consumer Stock Reconciliation Report (Supply Chain and Distribution)
The CA & US CH Stock Rec Bot pulls Daily Stock Reconciliation Reports from SAP by logging into CERPS and download the 4 reports for data assigned to 4 total plants, emailing the 4 reports to a defined stakeholder distribution list for further research and or record retention. This Bot eliminates effort for running this manually early morning (pre-work day) and creates error free reports. (Note : This Bot will be activated in Jan 2019 after year end processing is completed.)

GMM Planner Upgrade (US Suppy Chain and Distribution)
This new Bot is an update to the US GMM Promo Materials Bot, necessary as the ‚ÄòPlanner‚Äô application used for Promo Planning Material process management is being replaced by ‚ÄòVeeva Content Lab‚Äô application.  The Bot continues to automate the same process : access & read the TRACKER spreadsheet from the GSK Team Site to process GMM Code Requests, access CERPS (SAP) to process requests, extend to PR, and gather information for the DCF, and generate Daily, Weekly, and Error Reports and send to System Solutions team, but will now seamlessly integrate with the ‚ÄòVeeva Content Lab‚Äô.

Brexit Cost Centre Monthly Reporting (GMS Finance)
This bot is used to prepare and distribute month-end reports on 40+ Brexit-related cost centres across all markets. This report is used to review month charges across these cost centres, and monitor changes in balances during month-end close. This is run multiple times during WD1, WD2 and WD3. The bot gathers cost centre data from SAP, carries out currency conversions on the data to create a single unified dataset in GBP, then generates statistics such as monthly movements over the year for each cost centre. From end-to-end, the bot takes less than 5 minutes to get an up-to-date report directly to the Process Owner's mailbox and shared drive. As well as the time-saving benefits and increased accuracy of the reports, this bot saves over 100 hours of month-end effort annually, allowing for a more efficient and faster close each month.",Al Washco is with John Johnston and 5 others.,758,4,15:57,0,Sun,0.064643799

VFQ Daily Insight - Freedom culture
We talk about culture and how important it is to the lifeblood of an organization, but what are really asking for?
What type of culture do we want and how are we defining it by our actions and words? What questions are we asking or feel comfortable asking in order to get answers to the uncertain and complex issues?
If the freedom to ask questions and to challenge is something we believe will help us, then we need to demonstrate asking and challenging and communicate inside the organization, starting with our team.
Hal Gregersen just published his new book, Questions are the Answer - his basic premise is that we might be asking the wrong questions to try and solve our most challenging problems. Hal‚Äôs work in this area is worth knowing.
I‚Äôd add, however, that before we can determine if we‚Äôre asking the right questions, we need to make sure the people on our team know they have the freedom to ask any question.

VFQ Daily Insight - Wicked problems
A wicked problem is defined as:
‚ÄúA social or cultural problem that is difficult or impossible to solve for as many as four reasons: incomplete or contradictory knowledge, the number of people and opinions involved, the large economic burden, and the interconnected nature of these problems with other problems.‚Äù
Organizational change normally falls into wicked problem territory -  typically aligning to the four reasons given above. Adam Kahane wrote about solving tough problems, where he explained solutions to the wicked problem of South Africa and Apartheid using a technique called Scenario Planning which was invented at Shell. It‚Äôs a fascinating book and one that‚Äôs worth reading to learn about the technique itself, but also the dynamics of working on such an important social issue.
In the Shell Scenario Planning exercise there is a process that helps you to define a number of potential, realistic, but extreme, future scenarios. These might include economic, political, social, technological, or environmental factors to describe a future. The idea is to open up managers‚Äô and leaders‚Äô minds to the potential effects of underlying trends in the environment so they can prepare to respond to them in the future - if they ever happen to appear. It‚Äôs not about knowing the answers, but being aware of the signals.
Wicked problems aren‚Äôt solvable by lots of upfront planning and solution design. They are often believed to be impossible to solve completely and this certainly can‚Äôt be done through thinking alone. However, wicked problems can have solutions that impact in a positive or negative way. This can be done by running experiments, learning more about the problem space, and trying things to change the situation. Each step helps you develop deeper understanding and, hopefully, a positive impact as you move forward.

VFQ Daily Insight - Showing up
In a previous insight I used a quote by Woody Allen: 80% of success is showing up.
This applies when developing new products, services or systems as well as when things are live and operational. Stakeholders and customers need to know what‚Äôs going on.
Recently, I had an incident with my luggage on a flight. It went missing. Apparently, never to be seen again. Now, I fly a lot and I‚Äôm realistic about how things can go wrong. They often do. In terms of baggage issues, though, this is only the second time I‚Äôve had an issue in many, many years of flying. It just happens to be the same airline on the same route the last two times I‚Äôve flown it.
I was curious to see how they would handle this issue. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd agree if you lost your suitcase with a lot of stuff in it, you‚Äôd want some good customer service to follow-up with you. This airline did nothing. Even a week on there was no proactive follow-up on their part. I had emailed, phoned, and even went to social media. Eventually, after the social media complaint, they finally got engaged.
Showing up is key to retain customers. I‚Äôm a very loyal and frequent flyer. And now I don‚Äôt want to travel with them again. Not because of the original issue, but because of the way that they‚Äôve dealt with the issue. If someone had shown up to let me know they were handling the issue and that they cared about me as a customer then everything would be fine.
Showing up helps you learn. It helps you appreciate customer needs, stakeholder issues, and generally closes the gaps on understanding for you and them. If you don‚Äôt show up you can‚Äôt learn new things. And the only thing that you leave in a customer‚Äôs mind is that you don‚Äôt care enough for them.

Only once a package is valid and passing the configured controls, can it be published and thereby integrated into GSK's consolidation.

VFQ Daily Insight - The elephant and the rider
  Picture an elephant with a person on top of it ‚Äì the rider ‚Äì and a path ahead. Your aim is to make them move through that path. You can instantly guess that trying to persuade the rider alone will not be as effective, considering how strong the elephant is. But more than often that‚Äôs what we try to do. What do I mean by that? Think of the elephant as our emotional drives, often instinctive, and the rider as our rational, analytical side, responsible for our conscious decisions. There is a clear unbalance between these two competing voices and it is this unbalance that makes behaviour change so hard. Whether that is at a personal or at an organisational level.
Jonathan Haidt first introduced the concept in his book ‚ÄòThe Happiness Hypothesis.‚Äô Later on, Chip and Dan Heath made this concept more popular when they wrote their book ‚ÄòSwitch,‚Äô where they put it in the context of various change initiatives.
Their underlying message? If the elephant ‚Äì emotion ‚Äì does most of the work, we must find ways to continuously engage it. And of course, the first step is to acknowledge its existence and impact in everything that we do. Let‚Äôs be careful though not to fool ourselves that direction is not important. The rider‚Äôs input is still essential, it‚Äôs just not the most important vehicle to change.
Give your people direction but most importantly, keep them motivated. Find ways to make them believe that they can successfully implement and sustain change.

VFQ Daily Insight - Intuition versus data
Jeff Bezos said, ""If it comes down to intuition, then mine wins. If you want to change it produce and provide data to shift the argument.""
Every day we make decisions based on ‚Äògut feel‚Äô or intuition. We see things that look like what we‚Äôve seen before and we act in a way that we believe will lead to the right outcome. It‚Äôs how we‚Äôve always operated (and survived!). There are a lot of times when this sort of decision-making will win out. And it‚Äôs expedient.
However, complex situations aren‚Äôt always easily interpreted and answers aren‚Äôt easy to predict. Data and insights are required to come up with great strategies that go against a leaders or managers intuition. It‚Äôs important that within your own teams you work out how to come up with data and insights that validates, supports, or contradicts your ideas and work so that it explains to others why your approach is the right one or needs changing. Operating without this tends to lead to decisions being made solely by someone with greater hierarchical power. It doesn‚Äôt make it right.

Don't decide ... yet
We've all been in a situation of having to make a decision with imperfect knowledge. But is it always a time that the final decision has to be made? We often speak of a Cost of Delay, yet there are times when there might be a Benefit to Delay. Many in the Lean and Agile communities have written on the subject. Notably, Mary and Tom Poppendick have been ardent advocates of the Defer Commitment principle when it comes to decision making (also known as the Last Responsible Moment). It boils down to simple advice: If you can afford to wait before making an important decision, do. Ironically, it turns out that one of the best ways to improve decision making is to not take too many decisions early on.

VFQ Daily Insight - Transparency
Transparency is everything.
I recently received an email from an organization discussing the launch of their recent app:
'As with any new app, it's not without issues. I thank those who have had any tech issues for your patience and in an effort to be super transparent, we have a public Trello board that includes a list of all known issues we are facing and which the team are working hard on fixing.'
This openness with me, as the customer, is refreshing. Not many organisations are willing to admit ‚Äòtech issues‚Äô and discuss them openly in an all customer email. However, it made me consider that we all encounter these issues, and rather than shying away from them, we should acknowledge the opportunity they lend us to learn, grow and improve our products.
What I also admired in this email was their public facing board. This transparency showed me they care about their customers and are keen to act on feedback. It made me realise that more organizations need to embrace this kind of thinking, and challenge the concept of failure, to enable better relationships with customers.

VFQ Daily Insight - Empowerment without support
If you search the word ‚Äòleader‚Äô in a dictionary, you‚Äôd find definitions focusing on one‚Äôs ability to command and exercise control over others. If you ask some of the most effective leaders or HR specialists, like Ed Krow, you‚Äôre likely to get a different answer. It‚Äôs less about the title and more about people willingly following you. It‚Äôs about inspiring and empowering others.
Empowering leadership has become a popular practice in the past decade, given the numerous ways it fosters job satisfaction and employee enablement. But recent studies, examining 1,500 employees from about 150 companies across multiple industries, have shown that attempts to empower employees without providing support can cause confusion and resentment.
Trust plays an enormous part in the way people interpret working independently. Especially for people used to being closely supervised, an increase in their responsibilities alone can be detrimental. As an empowering leader you can‚Äôt just sit back and delegate more work to your employees. You can‚Äôt expect them to gain years of experience in decision making overnight. You have to be willing to listen. Ask for their opinion. Slowly build that trust and enable their creativeness. Make sure that the tasks assigned are indeed, creative. Overloading employees with more operational work, does not really ‚Äòempower‚Äô them and neither does it make you an effective empowering leader.

VFQ Daily Insight - Maintain status
There are very few things in business more satisfying to see than an employee who is selfless, one who puts others first and cares about the company they work for as much as the customers they serve.
Equally, there are very few things as distracting as an employee who does great work, but believes that that justifies the need to constantly ask for more of others and from others, instead of simply trusting that the people that can help them most are watching.
In both examples, the person achieves a certain status. One is achieved almost unconsciously because they‚Äôre not focusing on themselves. The other is achieved with more work because that is their primary focus and ironically, it doesn‚Äôt look or feel the same as the first person‚Äôs status.

Any initiative typically requires that we look at the fundamentals first.

Fundamentals are so important when we‚Äôre designing any new product or service or reshaping an organization. There are proven, well grounded principles we just need to apply and not necessarily change, but it isn‚Äôt supposed to end there.
While applying fundamentals is key, awareness of the sentimentals is also critical. Sentimentals are those things that we sometimes refer to as EQ or soft skills.

Bj√∂rn Goerke (SAP CTO) was very clear in his keynote speech that SAP in the Cloud is the future (Though at times it seemed that we were heading into space). The digital workplace and machine learning featured strongly too.
I focused on the SAP integration track, so forgive me if this is not your interest too.
Process Orchestration 7.5 seems to be the last of the on premise integration suites from SAP. The road map shows maintenance until 2024, but no new innovations. I believe SAP has stopped developing this product in favour of SAP Cloud Platform Integration (SCPI).
SCPI has a well developed roadmap with many innovations in the pipeline to make this the go to product.
Integration strategy can be summed up as
1. Out of the box integration
2. Open Integration
3. Holistic Integration
4. AI driven Integration
The highlights for me in integration was API Business Hub, Integration Content Advisor (ICA), Open Connectors and B2B integration.
ICA using machine learning and crowdsourcing to simplify interface development by 60% is probably the most exciting.
SAP Data Service are here to stay for the foreseeable future with no clear cloud replacement in sight.

In this post I want to focus on what we at GSK can do immediately in order to adapt our custom code to ensure compliance.  
SAP provides us with a simplification database, in which each item refers to a SAP note which describes the impact and how related custom code can be adapted.  To brows the simplification database we can use transaction SYCM.  
We should ensure that we create new code that that is SAP S/4HANA ready.
Setup remote ATC (ABAP Test Cockpit)
Use SAP S/4HANA ATC checks in our dev system  
We should collect productive usage and SQL execution data.
Switch on SCMON or UPL
Switch on SQL monitor  
Learnings from custom code migration project
Most custom code will run on SAP S/4HANA without adaptations
Remote code analysis in ATC is very helpful to analyse custom code on older releases
Helpful and easy to understand mitigations in SAP notes
SAP S/4HANA conversion is easy to understand and similar to a SAP ERP upgrade
Pure technical code adjustments are easy to fix with less effort 
New ABAP features likes ADT are essential in SAP S/4HANA
Don‚Äôt forget to plan the testing efforts
Getting rid of unused code before the conversion reduces the adaptation efforts drastically  
SAP S/4HANA is a new production and our custom code has to be adapted to  its changes.

VFQ Daily Insight - Make a difference
There‚Äôs an old African proverb that goes something like this:
‚ÄúIf you think you‚Äôre too small to make a difference, you haven‚Äôt spent a night with a mosquito.‚Äù
When you lead change in a large enterprise, it doesn‚Äôt take you too long to find people who don‚Äôt believe any positive change is possible. The narrative tends to be similar in that these people have tried before, but the system doesn‚Äôt allow change to happen. I‚Äôve met many people who have decided not to try any more. Large organizations and cultures can be tough to improve.
The trick is to be relentless. Different ideas take hold at different times. If you believe in an idea you need to keep going. Whilst not always easy, do it with good grace, humour and determination.

VFQ Daily Insight - One becomes two
It has been said, that to really understand a topic you must try to teach it. Much of our experience, knowledge, and learning is amassed informally over time. By that, I mean much of what we learn is outside of a classroom or a formal learning process. In order to solidify our knowledge we need to take it from being implicit to explicit. Teaching helps this process.
There is no-one who has your exact experience so they can‚Äôt really understand all of your perspectives and insights without exploring the topic together. When becoming a mentor or teaching others, you need to remember that it is always a two-way process. Both people get value by listening to each other and sharing insights.
In today‚Äôs fast-moving, customer-centric, digital world, learning fast is a competitive advantage to be able to adapt and respond to change. A learning culture is one that can be cultivated and encouraged. Remember, if no-one has your exact experience, it means you don‚Äôt have theirs either. Be open, be kind and listen to each other - we can all learn.

VFQ Daily Insight - Make mine a double...loop
Recently, a friend of mine was telling me about her troubles at work. She felt like she was being micromanaged, yet she wasn't getting any feedback to help her improve. Things came to a head when this friend brought the matter up with her manager. The manager, resentful of the perceived criticism, exclaimed that she had no choice ‚Äì after all, my friend always left assignments until the last minute!
This reminded me of an article by Chris Argyris in which he explains that most organizations are stuck in a mode of single-loop learning. Individuals at all levels tend to withhold information so as to maintain control of situations or avoid uncomfortable confrontations. The result is that while some behaviors might change to resolve the immediate problem, the underlying goals and assumptions are never questioned until it is too late.
My friend thought that she was being micromanaged because of a lack of trust in her ability to do the job. In fact, it wasn't the quality of the work that caused her manager to behave as she did, it was how she organized her time. Once this was made clear, my friend could shift her goal and focus her improvement efforts in the right place.
In order to quickly adapt to changing circumstances, organizations should be regularly engaging in double-loop learning. This means seeking a deeper understanding of a given situation ‚Äì getting to its roots cause, reviewing the validity of assumptions, and potentially adjusting their goals as a result.
Consider
What can you do to engage more often in double-loop learning?",Natasha Bennett shared a post.,785,0,14:26,0,Mon,0.001273885
127,20,29 10 2018,47,"GA&D RPA delivery total now at 23!! 11 Bot deliveries already in October and still one week to go‚Ä¶  
The GA&D RPA Team continues to increase output of RPA deliveries by delivering 11 so far in Oct for a total of 23 overall Bot deliveries (19 in the last 7 weeks) with over ¬£650k in measurable value.  Here is a quick overview of the Bots delivered in Oct:   
P2P KPI Reporting Sprint 1(EMEA Region): This is the first Bot of many to be delivered by the Genpact component of the RPA factory!  The GSK Finance Services P2P Key Performance Indicators Report is a key report utilized by the Finance Services Leadership Team to measure and evaluate FS performance.  Generating this report has taken a high level of manual effort, involving multiple data extracts, data validations, and consolidation of data ‚Äì limiting the report to being generated monthly. The P2P KPI Reporting Bot extracts raw data from several systems, cleanses and consolidates the data, then inputs the data into templates hosted in Qlikview.  Due to the speed in which the bot can generate the output, reports are now generated on a daily, weekly and monthly basis with improved quality and data accuracy. Manual effort for this activity has been eliminated, allowing focus on more value-added activities. Stakeholders can now access the most up-to-date KPI reporting metrics more frequently, allowing for more informed decision making.  Upcoming sprints will extend this Bot to cover all FS Regions (UK, NA, APAC, and LATAM).  
Data Power Message Failure Monitoring Bot: When outbound B2B transactions that are sent to GSK trading partners fail, the GA&D Middleware Team needs to manually resend the transactions.  The Bot eliminates the need for the Middleware Team to perform this activity by examining the failed transaction log, filtering the transactions which can be resent utilizing the partner lookup, resending the transactions, and updating the transaction log after successfully confirmation the resent transaction.  The Bot also handles exception scenarios ‚Äì sending email notifications containing additional technical information if the transaction resend fails.  This Bot reduces effort for the Ops Team, reduces the number of tickets handled by the B2B team, provides faster action on the failed transactions, and improves quality of service to external customers.  
PI/PO Payload Bot:  SAP PI/PO (Process Integration/Process Orchestration) is a tool that allows integration of systems and synchronization of data across the CERPs system landscape.  Messages and information sent through PI/PO is called the payload ‚Äì when a message failure occurs in SAP, a Remedy Ticket is automatically created.  The PIPO Payload Bot is used to update the Remedy Ticket system with the detailed ‚Äòpayload‚Äô information, by first obtaining the message id from Remedy, then logging into SAP downloading the ‚Äòpayload‚Äô for that message id, then updating the Remedy Ticket with the detailed information.  The result is the resolving agency has all the information needed to triage the issue in one system ‚Äì saving the time of logging into multiple systems and looking up information, reducing the amount of time needed to resolve PIPO message failures.
Extract T&E reports and information from CERPS: This bot automates the process of extracting T&E reports and related information from CERPS. The Legal and Audit team will request for the T&E information for audit purposes. Due to the confidentiality of these requests and data, the requests are traditionally processed manually by the GSK L3 Support team. The bot saved considerable amount of time and significantly improve the response time required by the Legal and Audit team.  
GEC - Automation of CDMS User Audit Reports: The CDMS bot automates the auditory process of user access in CDMS, including the addition, modification, and removal of user access across 5 different Local Business Units, all with separate access groups. This process involves checking user reports against the User Access Record (UAR) in CDMS to find any discrepancies. The bot then creates a report of the findings and send it to the Audit team. This improves the frequency and accuracy of audit check of CDMS user access.  
NA Automation of Stock Reconciliation Reports: The stock reconciliation reports that are used for SOX compliance have been manually pulled by a resource daily and sent out to stakeholders that provide inputs into any discrepancies. The Bot automates the extraction of the reports and emailing to a distribution list, eliminating the time consuming manual process, improving the internal service delivery, and increasing regulatory compliance. Plans for replicating the Bot to all GSK NA Markets are being developed.  
C&RM Automation of Adding Access Provisioning: This bot accommodates the Change and Release Management (C&RM) team by providing the SAP functional consultants and other users with the access to the appropriate C&RM shared folders. The bot will automatically check who has completed the mandatory C&RM courses in myLearning and then provide the user the access. Traditionally, the users needed to submit email requests to C&RM team, who manually granted access after confirming that training was completed.   
WBS Master Data Maintenance (Enhancement to DCF Sprint): The EDMO team has created a new WBS ‚ÄòBot Friendly‚Äô DCF form, which is easier to populate by end users, and easier for the WBS Bot to read and process.  The WBS Bot has been enhanced to utilize the new DCF for all of its‚Äô functionality to be delivered in upcoming sprints.  
WBS Master Data Maintenance (Change Functionality Sprint): As an extension of the work carried out by the original WBS ‚ÄòAdd‚Äô bot, the WBS Bot has been enhanced to process change requests for WBS.   
G2N Extracts & Essbase Data Load (Sequence of Reports Sprint): This month-end bot extracts GL account line item data from the CERPS system, processes the data into a format that is compatible with the Essbase system, and distributes the data to identified recipients for data load. This sprint focused on a new sequence of reports enhancements as well as several fixed required for full automation.  
SCF Exchange Rate Bot (Replicants - Wave 1): Evolving from the first Exchange Rate bot, this ‚Äòreplicant bot‚Äô will expand the SCF Exchange Rate functionality to process a subset of markets that have additional local requirements for processing exchange rate updates. Utilizing the original Bot framework, this replicant enhances the original functionality with the local requirements.",Al Washco is with Joe Touey and 3 others.,903,3,16:48,0,Mon,0.07751938

VFQ Daily Insight - Being part of the design process
  Recently, I had a customer dinner at a restaurant inside a beautiful hotel that was originally a historic building. The designers of the hotel took the building‚Äôs history into consideration and made sure that they left the old world charm while ensuring their hotel brand was evident.
The immediate feeling and emotion when you walked into the grand foyer was one of pride - pride in the history that this building displayed, but also in the opportunity to be there. Perhaps it sounds insignificant describing it in this way, but the designers wanted to extract specific reactions from customers for this purpose.
Thinking about how we develop culture in our organizations was top of mind after this experience. Being involved in the design of our organizations and the feelings and emotions we want to create for our people is critical to the success of the company and actually goes beyond just having good processes and controls.

If the action is the right one then maybe we need to say it differently, and sometimes it‚Äôs bigger than that.

When undertaking an Agile Transformation, we end up assessing our portfolio, trying to ensure that we invest in the most promising value propositions.

When Gartner wrote about the term bimodal a couple of years back, their aim was to call out the mode 1 and mode 2 reality of how organizations were structured and how they were trying to adapt to technological change.
If you look at this closer, it speaks to the budgeting strategy underpinning the decisions being made. For example, IT will say they need to keep the lights on (mode 1) and business leaders will want to design and implement a digital strategy (mode 2).
The fundamental areas of IT can be invisible to those setting the strategy and as a result, business leaders run the risk of not designing a complete budget - or another way to say it is that capacity isn‚Äôt often aligned well with the strategy.

Lots of fascinating technologies; controlling Fiori applications with your eyes, UI‚Äôs that recognise when the user is getting tired, applying machine learning to security and unlocking the power of devices with native mobile applications. On a personal level the focus on UI and UX was energising and motivating.
However the main thinking point for me wasn‚Äôt a specific application, language or technological leap but a fundamental change in the thinking and design principles behind the system architecture. An acknowledgement and conscious effort to move away from closed systems with proprietary programming languages that operate in isolation. By opening a technical landscape to multiple tools and development languages you build teamwork and utilise existing capabilities while driving new ideas and fresh thinking.

VFQ Daily Insight - Remember who has helped her
One 'talent' we all, unfortunately, possess is forgetting those who‚Äôve helped us along our journey. Even in our current assignment, we tend to dismiss or neglect the people that are often supporting us or making it possible for us to do the job we‚Äôre doing.
Sometimes authority and power goes to our head, sometimes we just think we know enough, and other times we work at a pace that isn‚Äôt helpful to us or others. In the process, we can easily forget to pause and recognize those that are right there with us or those people that were instrumental in helping us get where we are.
A good principle to follow is next time you think of the person that you appreciate, stop what you‚Äôre doing and let them know.
Consider
Don‚Äôt take people or situations for granted. Make it a habit to pause and recognize the people (boss, peers, team members, colleagues, etc.) who make it possible for you to be successful.",Natasha Bennett shared a post.,837,0,09:03,0,Fri,0

All businesses have a need to grow and scale. Whether it‚Äôs a new start-up looking for their first or second customer or the largest companies in the world looking to grow new sources of revenue or replace older sources.
Sam Altman from Y-Combinator suggests there is an easy way to scale and a hard way to scale. The easy way is when you have customers who love what you do for them, how you do it, and the results it achieves. The hard way is when you have a product or service that isn‚Äôt really that good for the current environment. Maybe customers once enjoyed your product, but because of changes in consumers, technology, or competition, they don‚Äôt really love (or even like) what you do any more. In this environment, you have to spend a lot more time generating demand and selling. It‚Äôs hard work. And it‚Äôs only going to get harder.
When you get into the territory where growth is hard and your customers fall out of love with what you do, you need to head back to the drawing board. You need to get back in front of important customers and figure out how to win them back. Make them love you again.

Consider
What can you do to make a handful of your users love your product or service more? It will make growth easier.",Natasha Bennett shared a post.,868,0,09:14,0,Tue,0

One of the three guiding principles at the heart of VFQ is ""Deliver value early and often."" 
The first step towards accomplishing this is breaking the work down into smaller pieces. One way this can be achieved is by looking at the problem through different prisms: 
- Risk 
- Urgency 
- Geography 
- Necessity 
- Stakeholder 
In a recent episode of Reid Hoffman's Masters of Scale podcast, there were two great examples of decision-making based on these prisms. 
The first was Spotify. In the early days, when Daniel Ek was struggling to get the music industry on board with his idea, he decided to shift strategy and focus just on Sweden ‚Äì a market where record companies were losing more than 80% of their revenue base. The second was Google. Back when they were just a small start-up, they partnered with Netscape. It turned out that they couldn't handle all the queries coming from their partner and still keep their own site online. In that moment of crisis, Larry Page chose to prioritize Netscape, recognizing the importance of building a long-term relationship with the company. 
By using the prisms of geography and stakeholders respectively, Spotify and Google were able to successfully break a big problem down and find the best area to focus their efforts.

There is research out there that suggests leadership principles will change dramatically in the next three to five years. One of those changes involves a shift away from what‚Äôs known as leading from the front to more of a style involving more participation.

I‚Äôd argue that participating is leading from the front. The very notion that somehow it‚Äôs not creates a mental divide in how an executive team might think about change. Maybe it‚Äôs semantics and perhaps that research isn‚Äôt trying to say that the two styles are vastly different, but it does raise a concern.

Companies that are successfully embedding new ways or working into their organizations know that a flat organization is not the answer. More agility is often associated with less hierarchy, but similarly to how some people read the agile manifesto, it doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúno‚Äù, but rather ‚Äúover‚Äù or ‚Äúless of‚Äù something. 
Global companies require hierarchy for all the reasons you know. The goal isn‚Äôt to eliminate hierarchy, it‚Äôs to flatten boundaries and bureaucracy by teaching people throughout the organization (top to bottom) to think differently. 
The emphasis needs to be on reconsidering how roles within the hierarchical structure behave in a new world and how they encourage new behaviors amongst the teams they interact with. Hierarchy is a good thing and with the right mindset shift it can dramatically change how an organization operates.

201,0,12 10 2018,,"VFQ Daily Insight - Scaffolding
There is a concept in learning theory called scaffolding. It is the idea that when learning new concepts, you start simple and progressively get more complicated over time. It is designed to increase motivation, engagement and enjoyment. Scaffolding happens within individual lessons or topics or even in entire disciplines or careers. 
One historically famous model is the Apprentice-\>Journeyman-\>Master journey. This is a model that has come and gone over time and is back in vogue. Another model often used in learning Agile and other new models is Shuhari. It is derived from martial arts and was the tried and trusted method to instruct students.  Shu is about an instructor protecting the student by only giving instructions that are specific and to be followed directly. The instructor doesn‚Äôt push a student beyond a limit. Ha is once all the basics have been mastered and the instructor starts detaching from day-to-day, offering specific guidance which allows the learner to digress and explore a topic more fully. By this stage the learner should have a feel for when things are working and when they‚Äôre not, and should be able to judge progress themselves. Ri is the final stage where the instructor leaves the student alone. Learners have now explored their subject matter fully enough to embark on their own and start creating new knowledge. 
At Emergn, we talk about three parts of learning that need to be balanced: mindset, mechanics, and measures. Measures is about keeping our eye on the outcomes that matter. These are the elements we need in place to judge whether our changes are making the desired improvements. Mindset is about the beliefs, attitudes, and thought processes. It‚Äôs the area that leads to long-lasting change. This is the most challenging domain as new ways of thinking can be hard to embed. Change happens over time when new techniques and outcomes are proven to work. This is where the Mechanics are required to put form to a new way of working. Early on with new teams and people, there is often a requirement to be more explicit and directive - not too explicit and directive, but enough to help people new to a topic explore it safely and start getting results.  
Consider Too much focus on any one of Measures, Mindset and Mechanics can lead to challenges in learning. Start with the mechanics, but there needs to be a good balance between the three to support people and teams.",Natasha Bennett shared a post.,929,0,08:33,0,Fri,0

Determined to continue her career doing what ‚Äúwomen were not supposed to be doing,‚Äù the pioneering powerhouse next enrolled at MIT and became that institution‚Äôs first woman to earn an M.S. in electrical engineering.

Over the length of my stay, the staff had learned what my preferences were and anticipated them. In the end, I found myself only thinking about the value of this experience and not the cost.

We have a process that after 3PL send C77 SHPCON interface message to ERP, Billing is automatically created after PGI and all required Outputs automatically determined and triggered externally to the email, associated with Bill-To party for this Customer. This basically does all the operations in a background for the Client and Outputs are distributed to the 3PL (Client can't start loading the truck without these Outputs). The idea was to process these operations as fast as possible in ERP.
First, we faced with a known issue with C77 SHPCON messages that when it reaches PI/PO, it splits into 2 parts (idocs): PIC and PGI. These idocs reach ECC at the same time and in most cases PGI idoc is smaller in size and it reaches ECC first and blocks the Delivery, thus PIC idoc can't be processed and fails as well. It means that we have to wait for reprocessing job here.
Second, we faced with some complexities in automation at the stage when all operations, like PGI, Billing and Output determination with external send are processed immediately one after another. It was discovered that few internal tables for CDN consumption require some time for respective updates and thus our Outputs with immediate processing logic were triggered without required information (thanks to Sanjeev Singh and Jude D'Souza for the analysis). To avoid this - additional Batch job was implemented, which added again more time to the overall processing.
As a Third, these Outputs are put into SOST for external send and it also adds another time for the overall timing.
Initially the E2E processing time was more than 30 mins, which was not acceptable by the Business at all and we raised some requests to change the frequency and start/end timing for all our Jobs.
Now I could say that the overall processing E2E time is around 7-12 mins (from the stage when 3PL triggered C77 message and received Outputs in Inbox) and we try to reduce it further. Some additional changes for the Batch Jobs were initiated, which will hopefully allow us to reduce the E2E time even more.
This is a clear example that Automation is not an easy thing to do and it opens a lot of aspects of system behavior, which were not known before!
P.S We will try to raise a BCR for splitting PIC and PGI interface messages not in PI/PO, but at #3PL. We have already qualifier ""PICK ONLY"", which does only picking, but don't have ""PGI"" one, which should be pass through PI/PO, but this is a separate topic.",Denis Gorbunov is with Natalia Zhigacheva and 6 others.,974,0,13:36,0,Wed,0.009240246

Look up the meaning of the word ""entrepreneur"" and you‚Äôll find that all the definitions have the following in common: An entrepreneur is doing something new, and they are pursuing the creation of value. Depending on who you ask, they may also be willing to take on some risks in the process.
That is not to say that all entrepreneurs exhibit the same behaviors. Indeed, they may be more or less open to the possibilities around them and have different attitudes towards risk and uncertainty.
On that basis, Dimo Dimov and Joseph Pistrui define four categories of entrepreneurial mindsets:
- The focused entrepreneur: Their innovation is usually centered around enhancing their present activities. 
- The incremental entrepreneur: They look beyond their current business for new opportunities; making use of existing capabilities in new ways.
- The playful entrepreneur: They are always questioning the status quo and aren‚Äôt afraid to experiment to try out new ideas.
- The breakaway entrepreneur: They‚Äôre constantly searching for the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù and don‚Äôt shy away from taking risks to bring their great idea to life.
Many of us don't think of ourselves as entrepreneurs because we haven't set up our own company. But we should. When we consider what constitutes the core of entrepreneurial behavior: identifying, pursuing, and delivering valuable ideas, is that not something that can be practiced at all levels of an organization? Are we not all trying to create value ‚Äì whether we own the business or are its employees?

Currently, this is a manual activity and takes significantly longer than the time available in the month end calendar, resulting in very long working hours for the US Rx team.  The Bot will reduce the number of working hours, reduce risk of errors in manipulating the data, and will help to ensure on time month end close.
SMAS Month end PPV: The PPV EGOL BOT downloads a Business Intelligence Report, extracts the relevant data into excel and posts journals based on the amount and materials in the report. The BOT performs the repetitive tasks and allows the SMAS team to focus on the analysis and production of the final report, during the busy and time constrained month end period. 
Both of thes Bots will support the September Month End close process in ‚Äòassisted‚Äô mode, with a target of full automation for October Month End.

COMING SOON
DECEMBER 11, 2018
We're kicking off PI-3 today and couldn't be more excited about the direction that our Platforms organization is headed. The team's first program increment (PI-2) was a huge success and everyone is now rallied around our vision to...
Empower our builder communities to create better products, more quickly.
As preparation for the release of our first version of the GSK Platform Experience, we will begin onboarding our tech partners across R&D, Pharma, Vaccines, Consumer Health, Information Security, and more (!!!) in the coming weeks.
The first version of the GSK Platform Experience will cover initial enterprise-ready MVPs in the following areas:
API Inventory
Cloud Services
CI/CD Toolchain
Web Component Library
Universal Design System
Most importantly, as an agile-native crew of design and engineering pirates, we're committing to biweekly production releases starting in PI-4 next January 2019, to ensure we bring maximum value at maximum speed to GSK's Tech Community.
Check out this teaser trailer we put together over the weekend of where we've been the past three months and a sneak peek of some of the tools we're building to ignite our builder culture starting December 11th!!

248,0,27 09 2018,,"Try, try, and try again - VFQ Daily Insight
When something is hard, there can be a tendency to want to avoid the thing and work around it. This is known as avoidance and can lead people to a point where they aren‚Äôt prepared to tackle the reality in front of them. Instead, they prefer to consider the hard task a fixed constraint. 
The alternative to avoidance is exposure. This is a psychological approach to dealing with challenging situations where people are exposed over and over to the challenging situation. 
There are a lot of challenges in building, releasing, and planning software projects and digital products. Over the years I‚Äôve seen many companies optimize delivery schedules and deployments to be once or twice a year. In addition, I‚Äôve seen teams shy away from engaging and planning with stakeholders. The reasons? They‚Äôre both really hard to do. Both infrequent deployment and infrequent planning leads to unfocused teams, slow delivery, and low value deployments of features. 
The best way to improve in this situation is to develop the muscle of continuous planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. I know, for some, this can feel like an incredibly high bar. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs typically avoided. But, it is achievable! By tackling projects and tasks that are hard again and again, they will become easier over time. 
Consider 
What do you do in your team today that works around something you‚Äôre trying to avoid? Start tackling it head on.

This highly complex Bot is being deployed to process DCFs for assets under construction with capital and revenue project expenditure - 50% of the DCFs received. This automation will eliminate manual processing of the data and improve data accuracy.

285,3,10 09 2018,2,"Hi all,
I'm a software engineer working in GSK R&D, as a member of Core Technologies (within Product Development and Supply).
I've been working on an web application (implemented in ASP.NET) that that sends a request URL to an external weather service, in order to retrieve information about the next few day's weather.
It's in a bit of a bind, however; whenever I try to make the request as the application's running, it throws an error.
On closer inspection I learned the error is caused by the connection being closed by something external to the server (Socket Error 10054, if that helps).
My working theory is that the GSK firewall is preventing a successful connection from the calling application, or that
the connection isn't being properly configured from within the application; my reason for this is that the request URL
returns the appropriate response when put into a browser, and no other applications we've worked on in the past have had this issue.
If anyone reading this has any experience working with .NET and you've had to deal with similar issues in the past, your insight would be greatly valuable!

Introducing: Oneboard ‚Äì A Central Hub for Onboarding
As part of the Transformation Hackathon, myself, Charlotte Collins and Christina Whitworth have submitted an idea on how the onboarding experience could be revolutionised.
Find out more and give us a thumbs up here: https://ignitegsk.com/newhireonboarding/Page/ViewIdea?ideaid=30850
We aim to:
- Provide a portal that leverages existing applications and services such as the Service Catalog and Workday to automate tasks and auto-populate information ‚Äì for example, a new hire can instantly submit a service request for a specific file share access with one click of a button.
- Have one single, unified onboarding flow that incorporates everything that a new hire would need ‚Äì including activities done across Business Units and tasks specific to certain teams.
- Give managers the tools to quickly develop onboarding flows from pre-built (or custom) blocks, and then assign them to new hires on the fly.
- Allow employees to track tickets-in-progress for items like file share requests, Remedy tickets and SharePoint requests.
- Allow new hires to automatically send mails and meeting invites to the right people with a single click ‚Äì for example, after completing a certain set of training modules, a manager may want their new hire to have an introduction chat with a specific member of the team.
- Provide real-time progress of new hires to managers ‚Äì how far have they progress on their onboarding journey, what is the next step in their flow, is there any approvals to be signed off, what problems have the new hires reported during onboarding, etc.
Take a look at our concept art, have a read of the IGNITE submission and give us a thumbs up if you like the idea! Every vote counts and will increase our chances of making this idea a reality.",Niall Rose,1136,2,12:55,0,Wed,0.009683099

I have a challenging question and would like to get some expert feedback from the Community.
As you probably heard, Russian Market will be the first one using full T&T model and every operation (including PACK/UNPACK activities) should be reported to the National Healthcare System (#NHS). For the transient period (I assume around 2 years), LOC warehouses will have serialised and non-serialised #Batches for the same GMM on stock and one of the main requirements from the Distributors is to distinguish these serialised and non-serialised Batches into separate Deliveries.
The reason for this is that our Clients have to Receive (and later manage) serialised Batches differently from the other Batches. After GSK ships #Serialised Products to the Distributor, we have to report data against this Delivery to NHS and our Distributor will receive corresponding #ASN message from NHS with all SSCC details, and ASN details should match physical goods one-to-one. In case of any discrepancies, for example Distributor received more Products physically than in ASN message - they reject Receipt operation and it will be returned to GSK for investigation.
So, the question here is how to distinguish serialised Batches from non-serialised ones into separate Deliveries by Customer Service Operations in #ERP? Maybe there is any parameter on a Batch level, which could be used by #BatchAllocation Strategy and be visible at the Delivery Creation Stage for Customer Service?
If you have any other ideas here - please join the conversation, your input will be appreciated.",Denis Gorbunov is with Alessandra Tomasetta and 11 others.,1153,0,10:03,0,Tue,0.000867303

The Product Owners (PO) designed several scenarios to run through the system as a customer would within the Spanish market, to gain feedback into the look and feel of the product. If we look at this from a MVP viewpoint, there was some immediate feedback that the team can take away that could bring further value to the customer. Some of the feedback was positive, some negative, but we need to ensure that we take the objective points forward and hopefully plan these into future sprints.
The UX lab itself is an impressive setup and run extremely efficiently with no time wasted, which allowed us to get the most out of each session with the user. It is also extremely useful to have the eye tracking software visible during the session as it allows the observer to see how the person is viewing sections of the screen.
Once we have the full detailed report we will post the outcome of the testing sessions.

We have successfully completed our first serialised data upload (GTIN master and batch data, more than 65,000 Serial numbers in one shot!!!) to the European Medicines Verification System (EMVS) and Slovenian National Medicines Verification System for two SKUs for the Slovenian market - making those products traceable from manufacture to patient at single pack level.  
Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) will come into force by February 2019. Non-compliance would impact sales revenue from EU market which is currently around 5.4 bn.  
This marks the final deployment of Release 7 & 8 Project as part of Fingerprint Programme. Just to mention some of the milestones across 2017-8 to get where we are today: 
Corporate SAP ATTP system (GSK Serialisation Enterprise system) upgraded to Version 2.1
Integration with Vaccines ATTP system enabling Vx and Rx businesses to use one system for Serial numbers generation, supply chain reporting and regulatory reporting
Validation of new version of Site serialisation system allowing sites to serialise products as per EU FMD compliance to be deployed across 20 factories.
Laid the foundation for Strategic integration with our CMOs, Customers (other MAH for which GSK manufactures products), 3PLs and Regulators by connecting our SAP ATTP system with SAP ICH (Information Collaboration Hub for Life Sciences - Cloud platform solution). After successful go lives with Pilot CMO and Customer, deployments are on going to achieve 120 connections by end of 2019. 
The dedication, passion and effort put by the team is really outstanding . Only their hard work made this possible.

As a high level description of the process: learners who fail to complete certain learning programmes on time have their email turned off in Exchange in the hope this gets their attention and causes them to complete the programme prior to being submitted to HR Ops for discipline processing. Systems involved in any automation would be myLearning, Exchange, Remedy (to check if tickets are open for the incomplete learner) and the HR ODS (to confirm the learner is not on leave). People involved goes across GEC, HR Ops, GA&D Tech, Platforms/Ops Tech, and the Learning folks.
Today, we use a combination of QlikView, Excel, manual processing steps, and a script that ineracts with Exchange to actually turn the email off for the user. We are delivering enhancements in the Qlik space but can't fully automate the process. We've also discussed HANA-based integration but that will be a few years out (SuccessFactors Learning HANA integration)

""What do you typically say when you are telling someone you need to search for something online? I‚Äôm guessing for most people, we now say ‚ÄúI need to google it‚Äù ‚Äì this is why ‚Äògoogle‚Äô is an actual word in the dictionary. We‚Äôve associated the name of a company with the actual behavior or action that it encompasses.
We‚Äôve done something similar to the word ‚Äòagile‚Äô. We say things like ‚Äúwe want to implement agile‚Äù or ‚Äúthis is our agile program‚Äù, as if to say that agile is as tangible as Google is a search engine. The only problem is that, unlike Google, the word ‚Äòagile‚Äô represents many ideas and actions to so many people.
Agile not only describes an anticipated behavior, but it also represents several disparate methodologies, practices, belief systems, and more. The challenge of assigning so much value to this word is that we can easily misinterpret what we mean by it for our own organization.
Consider
Perhaps it‚Äôs better to describe the outcomes we expect from introducing and adopting new ways of working, than rolling it all up into one word.""",Steve Morton,1507,0,07:55,0,Wed,0.01592568

 The workshop was focussed on re-confirming the scope and playback of key design assumptions in mid-level design  before we start the build phase to avoid any re-work later.    
This signals the next phase of the Project in which GA&D begins to move out of its Detailed Design Phase and into Realisation where execution of proposed changes can begin.
